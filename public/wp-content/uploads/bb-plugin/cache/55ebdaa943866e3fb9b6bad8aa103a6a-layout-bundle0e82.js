From catering to entertainment, vendors play a crucial role in shaping your attendee experience. But with so many options out there, how do you find the right ones? Our team is here to show you how to find and pick event vendors!\n\n\n\nTypes of vendors for events\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into how to find event vendors, let\u2019s break down the types of event vendors you might need when planning an event.\n\n\n\n\nCatering services: Ensure your guests are well-fed with food and beverage options that fit your event\u2019s style and budget.\n\n\n\nAudio\/Visual (A\/V) providers: Set the stage with sound systems, lighting, microphones, and projectors to ensure your programming and entertainment run smoothly.\n\n\n\nPhotography and videography: Capture key moments and create content for social media and future promotional efforts.\n\n\n\nFloral designers: Elevate the ambiance of your venue with fresh floral arrangements and decorations.\n\n\n\nEntertainment providers: Book performers, DJs, or speakers to set the energy and keep your attendees engaged.\n\n\n\nFurniture and equipment rental: Secure essentials like chairs, tables, tents, and staging to create your ideal floor layout.\n\n\n\nTransportation services: Help your guests arrive comfortably with shuttles, buses, or valet services.\n\n\n\nEvent security:&nbsp; Hire experienced personnel to monitor your event\u2019s safety and ensure it's a secure environment for all attendees.\n\n\n\n\nHow are vendors different from sponsors?\n\n\n\nVendors provide services in exchange for payment, whereas sponsors contribute funds, products, or services in exchange for brand exposure. However, sometimes a vendor can also be a sponsor by offering a discount or complimentary service in exchange for marketing opportunities at your event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to find vendors for an event\n\n\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the types of services your event might need, let\u2019s get into the practical tips on how to find and pick the best event vendors!\n\n\n\n1. Define your specific vendor needs first\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, create a list of the vendors you actually need and will plan to reach out to. Consider the size of your event, the number of attendees, your event theme, and attendees\u2019 expectations. Your event budget should also be a primary factor \u2014 prioritize essential services while considering what extra expenses are worth it to elevate the experience. For example, a live artist painting scenes from your event could add a unique touch, or a specialty dessert station could create a memorable experience for attendees. Interactive experiences like photo booths or custom merchandise stations can also add an extra layer of fun!\n\n\n\n2. Tap into your network\n\n\n\nReferrals are extremely valuable when it comes to finding reliable vendors. As a solid place to start, ask fellow event organizers and venue managers for recommendations, since they often have a go-to list of trusted vendors. Reach out to past vendors you\u2019ve worked with for referrals too. Join industry groups, local event vendor associations, or chamber of commerce groups to expand your connections. You also can\u2019t go wrong with exploring Facebook Groups and LinkedIn for even more vendor recommendations in your industry.\n\n\n\n3. Research and vet vendors thoroughly\n\n\n\nEvery vendor comes with its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so take the time to vet them properly. Read online reviews on Google, Yelp, and industry-specific forums. Review their portfolio to see if their past events align with your vision. Wanting to research even further? Ask for references from previous clients to hear about their experiences firsthand.\n\n\n\n4. Attend local events &amp; expos\n\n\n\nSeeing vendors in action can help you make the right decision! Attend local live events similar to yours, observe the vendors working onsite, and learn firsthand how they operate. Take notes on their booth setups, product displays, and quality of service to assess if they\u2019d perform well at your events too. If possible, you should also check out any industry expos and trade shows going on to network with tons of vendors in one place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Interview vendors like a pro\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your list of vendors, it\u2019s time to schedule interviews with each of them to discuss the details. Key topics to ask them about include their availability on your event date, pricing, setup logistics, and cancellation policies. Ask questions about their experience with similar events and clarify what\u2019s included in their contract. Most importantly, always get everything in writing to ensure there are clear expectations on pricing, deliverables, and responsibilities between you and your vendors.\n\n\n\n6. Negotiate strategically&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSmart negotiation tactics can ensure you\u2019re getting the best value from your vendors and stay within your event budget. When negotiating with prospective vendors, be upfront about your budget and compare their offer against what other vendors are offering you and what you understand of the industry rates. As another way to cut costs, ask for package deals or bundled services. You could also offer marketing exposure, such as social media shoutouts or branding opportunities, in exchange for discounts.\n\n\n\n7. Plan for vendor backup options\n\n\n\nEven the best-laid plans can take an unexpected turn, so it\u2019s always a good idea to have backup vendors. Create a shortlist of alternative companies to contact in case any of your current vendors cancel. It\u2019s also super important that you discuss any cancellation policies in your deals to hopefully avoid this from happening in the first place. Ideally, you want to partner with vendors who are transparent with you about their contingency plans, such as extra staff or backup equipment, to avoid any last-minute mishaps.\n\n\n\n8. Build long-term vendor relationships\n\n\n\nBuilding long-term relationships with high-quality vendors is essential! Start by setting clear, professional expectations so everyone\u2019s on the same page right from the start. Then, treat your vendors like true partners. For example, share behind-the-scenes info about your event goals or challenges they can help solve. When they knock it out of the park, show your appreciation! Rebook them for future events and spread the word about their services to others in your network. You can also give back by offering testimonials about their company or sharing a glowing social media shoutout. These simple gestures not only help them grow their business but also ensure they stay excited to work with you year after year.\n\n\n\nSealing the deal&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinding the right event vendors takes research, networking, and a little negotiation \u2014\u00a0 when done right, it makes a huge difference in the success of your event! Start early, vet thoroughly, and invest intentionally into your vendor relationships for smoother event planning down the line.\n\n\n\nAs a trusted ticketing vendor for over 20 years, thousands of events use TicketLeap to sell tickets online and manage their events, and get paid fast.

When it comes to selling tickets on your ticketing platform, you\u2019re handling sensitive financial details that need to be locked down tight. That\u2019s where two-factor authentication (2FA) comes in. Sure, it might take an extra few seconds to complete your login, but those moments are a small price in exchange for the peace of mind you\u2019ll gain knowing your account is secure from hackers and other bad actors.\n\n\n\nWhat is two-factor authentication and why do I need it?\n\n\n\nBecause of the large amounts of attendee data, events are a perfect target for phishing attacks. This includes the data and financial information housed in your ticketing platform. At TicketLeap, we want to secure your account to prevent your account from getting into the wrong hands. What\u2019s one important way we prevent this? We make sure your account has two-factor authentication!\n\n\n\nEven with a super complex password, your account is still at risk without this extra barrier of protection. Two-factor authentication requires you to verify your login with a code sent to an external device. That way, even if someone cracked your password, your account is still safe!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Cyber Defense Agency, the use of 2FA on your accounts makes you 99% less likely to be hacked. At the end of the day, this extra layer or protection is a critical element to keeping your online accounts secure. Opting against using 2FA puts both you and your accounts at significant risk.\n\n\n\nHow does two-factor authentication work on TicketLeap?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s simple! You can set up two-factor authentication in just minutes and choose to receive a code when you log in through either text or an authentication app such as Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile. If multiple people need access to your account (we\u2019ll talk more about this in a second), an authentication app may be the best option for you. If you want to learn more about how our 2FA feature works, visit this help article!\n\n\n\nHow to make your login more efficient while staying secure\n\n\n\nWanting to avoid entering a code every time you log into your account? When you log in from a private computer or mobile device (such as your personal laptop or phone), just click the \u201cRemember Me\u201d box at the bottom of the login form. This will keep you logged in for the next 30 days. Keep in mind however, if you have your settings to delete cookies when closing your browser, this feature will not work.\n\n\n\nWhat if multiple staff members need to access your account?\n\n\n\nTicketLeap is a powerful ticketing system with role-based permissions that you can assign to your team members. That way, each person in your organization should have their own login credentials and specialized view of your account. Depending on the type of role they\u2019re assigned, some roles will require two-factor authentication while others won\u2019t. This will be important to coordinate, especially to ensure everyone who does need two-factor authentication can access it.\n\n\n\nOnly users with the following roles require two-factor authentication to be enabled:\n\n\n\n\nOwner accounts (the account that created the organization)\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\n\nIf certain staff members don\u2019t need access to the financial portions of our TicketLeap (e.g., payouts, bank account info), then you can give them one or more of the following roles to skip two-factor authentication:\n\n\n\n\nEvents Manager: This role helps create and update event listings, including creating and editing events, changing the privacy settings, updating your fees and sales tax, and creating or modifying discounts.\n\n\n\nBox Office Manager: This role deals with your ticket buyers and attendees, including scanning and selling tickets onsite, running reports, managing order details, issuing refunds, and processing ticket exchanges.\n\n\n\nTicket Check-In: This role just has access to our mobile ticket scanning app and your attendees report.\n\n\n\nTicket Sales: This role has access to our box office feature on desktop and our ticket selling app.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you use TicketLeap features regularly but don\u2019t typically need access to your payment settings or sales report, you can create one of these user accounts for yourself to manage your day-to-day tasks without needing 2FA to log in.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nQuick tip: You can set up a user with multiple permissions as needed. For example, a user that has both Events Manager and Box Office Manager roles.\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts on two-factor authentication\n\n\n\nAs event organizers, we know your focus is on creating unforgettable experiences for your audiences \u2014 but safeguarding your business is just as important. While two-factor authentication might take a few extra seconds during login, it\u2019s a small investment of time that\u2019s worth the immense security it brings. Protecting your accounts from unauthorized access ensures your financial information, attendee data, and event details stay secure for years to come!\n","date":"6 Mar 2025","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/person-using-two-factor-authentication-on-laptop-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

Local search engine optimization (or local SEO for short) helps your event get discovered by people who are actively looking for something to do nearby. The best part?

In their chosen search engine, people use location-specific terms like \u201clive music near me\u201d or \u201ccharity run in Tampa\u201d to find events happening around them. To show up in these searches, your event details need to be optimized for discovery, which includes structuring your website correctly and getting listed on the right platforms. Additionally, while Google is the dominant player, people also search for events on Apple Maps, Bing, and social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. With this in mind, you\u2019ll want to make sure you optimize your event\u2019s local SEO for these platforms too.\n\n\n\nHow do you set up a Google Business Profile for an event?\n\n\n\nA Google Business Profile (GBP) is an essential first step to get your event to appear in Google Search and on Google Maps. It helps increase your event\u2019s visibility, makes it easier for local attendees to find key details like location and ticketing, and boosts credibility through reviews and engagement. Here\u2019s how to set it up:\n\n\n\n\nGo to Google Business Profile and create an account.\n\n\n\nChoose the right category: If your event has a fixed venue, select categories like \u201cEvent Venue\u201d or \u201cLive Music Venue.\u201d If it\u2019s a one-time event, create a profile under your organization and list the event separately.\n\n\n\nFill in accurate event details: Add the event name, date, time, location, ticketing link, and contact details.\n\n\n\nUpload high-quality images: Selecting a compelling cover image and relevant event photos will make your listing stand out.\n\n\n\nEncourage reviews and interactions: Positive reviews increase your credibility and help your event rank higher in search results.\n\n\n\nUse Google Posts: Regularly update your business profile on Google with event announcements, ticket sales info, and special offers. Your posts can appear in Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Business Profile website.\n\n\n\n\nHow can you optimize your event website for local search?\n\n\n\nBy implementing key SEO tactics, you can improve your site\u2019s visibility and attract more local traffic. Here are a few ways to enhance your event website for local search:\n\n\n\nCreate a dedicated landing page\n\n\n\nAn SEO-friendly page is well-structured, easy to navigate, and contains all the essential details, including the event\u2019s name, date, location, ticket info, and keywords that help search engines understand what the page is about.\n\n\n\nEmbed Google Maps\n\n\n\nEmbedding Google Maps onto your website makes it easier for attendees to find your event and reinforces your event\u2019s location to search engines. You can do this by going to Google Maps, searching for your venue, clicking \u201cShare,\u201d then selecting \u201cEmbed a map\u201d and copying the provided HTML code into your event webpage.\n\n\n\nUse schema markup\n\n\n\nEvent schema is a structured data format that helps search engines understand the details of your event and allows you to have a more rich appearance in search results. Implementing it involves adding JSON-LD structured data to your event\u2019s website or ticketing page, which includes fields like event name, date, time, location, and ticketing URL. If you use an event ticketing solution like TicketLeap, your ticketing page will automatically have this for you.\n\n\n\nEnsure your site is optimized for mobile devices\n\n\n\nA mobile-friendly website loads quickly, adjusts to different screen sizes, and provides a smooth user experience. Google\u2019s Page Speed Insights can help check your site\u2019s performance on mobile devices.\n\n\n\nOptimize titles and meta descriptions\n\n\n\nInclude your event name and location in your page title, headers, and event descriptions to improve search engine rankings and click-through rates.\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to keep your event details consistent across all platforms?\n\n\n\nKeeping your event details consistent across all platforms is essential for local SEO and making sure your event is easy to find. Whether it's on your event\u2019s ticketing website like TicketLeap or niche directories like Songkick for concerts, having the same details everywhere builds trust with both search engines and your audience. Make sure things like the event name, date, time, venue, and ticket options match up across all platforms. Staying consistent helps improve your local search rankings and makes it easier for attendees to get the info they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you use local keywords to attract more attendees?\n\n\n\nThe right keywords help people find your event! Find the best keywords by using tools like Google Keyword Planner and Google Trends to identify phrases related to your event like \u201cfood festival near me\u201d, \u201cconcerts in Salt Lake City\u201d, or \u201ccharity run in Detroit.\u201d Then, place those keywords strategically on your website by using them in your titles, meta descriptions, headers (H1s), alt text for images, and event descriptions.\n\n\n\nHere is a brief description for each optimized local SEO element and an example of what each might look like for a food festival in Austin, TX:\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The title is the clickable headline that appears in search engine results. It should be concise, include the event name and location, and entice users to click.\n\nExample: \"Food Festival in Austin \u2013 Best Local Eats &amp; Live Music\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta description: This is the short summary that appears below the title in search results. It should be compelling, include key event details, and encourage users to take action.\n\nExample: \"Join us for the annual Austin Food Festival! Enjoy amazing local eats, live music, and family-friendly fun. Get your tickets now!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMain header (H1): The H1 is the main title displayed on the top of your event page. It helps both users and search engines understand what your event is about. It should be clear, descriptive, and include relevant keywords.\n\nExample: \"Austin Food Festival \u2013 A Culinary Experience You Can\u2019t Miss!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlt text for images: Alt text is a short description added to images for accessibility and SEO. It helps search engines understand the content of your images and improves visibility in image search results.\n\nExample: \"Crowd enjoying delicious food at Austin Food Festival 2025\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent description: This is the detailed information about your event that appears on your website and listings. It should include the event\u2019s name, date, location, key highlights, and a call to action.\n\nExample: \"Experience the flavors of Austin at the 2025 Austin Food Festival. Featuring the city\u2019s top chefs, local vendors, and live entertainment, this is the must-attend event of the season. Located at Zilker Park, the festival runs from June 15-17. Secure your tickets today!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can building local citations and backlinks improve event SEO?\n\n\n\nLocal citations are when other websites mention your event in their content, while backlinks are when these outside sources link off to your event website. Both of these improve search rankings and boost your reputation. They\u2019re super important because they build social proof and drive traffic to your website. Curious how you can get them? Here are a few quick tips!\n\n\n\n\nReach out to local bloggers, influencers, and news sites to cover your event. You can send press releases to local media outlets about your event. Or even offer influencers and bloggers free event access in exchange for coverage.\n\n\n\nPartner with local businesses for cross-promotion and sponsorship mentions. Ask nearby restaurants, hotels, or stores to share your event on their websites or social media and offer to promote their business in return (e.g., include their name on event signage or offer event discounts for their customers).\n\n\n\nGet listed on tourism and city event calendars by reaching out to local tourism boards and city websites. Many cities have online event submission forms, so take advantage of these free promotional opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nHow does social media impact local search visibility for events?\n\n\n\nSocial media isn\u2019t just for engagement anymore \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a major search engine! Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook are changing the way people find events, with users increasingly searching for things to do directly within these apps. This means that optimizing your social media presence can significantly impact your event\u2019s local search visibility. Here\u2019s how to optimize it:\n\n\n\n\nCreate engaging event pages on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Regularly update with teaser content, behind-the-scenes footage, and countdowns.\n\n\n\nUse location-based hashtags and geotags to increase local reach. Add hashtags like #AustinFoodFestival or #ConcertsInLA to reach local searchers.\n\n\n\nEngage with local communities and influencers to spread the word. Share your event in local Facebook groups or Reddit threads or partner with micro-influencers who have engaged local followings.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is user-generated content and reviews important for event SEO?\n\n\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is any content \u2014 photos, videos, testimonials \u2014 created by attendees rather than your brand. UGC is powerful because it builds trust and authenticity. Potential attendees often rely on reviews and social proof before deciding whether to buy tickets. Here\u2019s how to encourage them:\n\n\n\n\nAsk attendees to leave reviews on Google, Facebook, and Yelp. Send post-event emails thanking attendees and linking directly to review pages or even offer incentives (e.g., entry into a giveaway) for leaving honest feedback.\n\n\n\nEncourage social shares by creating branded hashtags and running contests. Develop a unique event hashtag and promote it on all materials. Run a contest where attendees post photos taken in a photo booth at your event with your hashtag for a chance to win a prize.\n\n\n\nFeature user-generated content on your event pages and social media. You can even create a \u201cWhat People Are Saying\u201d section on your event page!\n\n\n\n\nWhat tools can you use to track and improve local SEO for events?\n\n\n\nTracking your event\u2019s local SEO performance isn\u2019t just something you do at the end \u2014 it\u2019s an ongoing process that helps you refine your strategy and make necessary adjustments along the way. Ideally, you should check your performance weekly leading up to the event to see if your pages and listings are gaining traction. Daily monitoring may be helpful in the final days before the event to maximize visibility. After the event, reviewing performance data helps you understand what worked well and what needs improvement for future events. Useful local SEO tools include:\n\n\n\n1. Google Search Console\n\n\n\nUse Google Search Console to track the performance of how your website or landing page ranks in search results for location-based queries. It can also help you detect any issues with your pages. For instance, if your event is in a specific city, you can monitor how well your page ranks for keywords like \u201cevents in Dallas\u201d and identify if there are issues with indexing or mobile performance that need addressing.\n\n\n\n2. Google Analytics\n\n\n\nThis platform helps you monitor where your traffic is coming from. You can use Google Analytics to see audience insights like how many visitors are from the event\u2019s location, how they found your site, and what pages they interact with the most. This helps refine targeting and conversion strategies.\n\n\n\n3. Google Business Insights\n\n\n\nBy setting up a Google Business Profile for your event, you can track how users are finding your event, whether through direct searches (e.g., your event name) or discovery searches (e.g., searching for terms like \u201cevents near me\u201d). Google Business Insights also shows actions people take on your profile, such as calling or requesting directions, helping you optimize for local visibility.\n\n\n\n4. Analytics on your social media accounts\n\n\n\nMonitoring engagement on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook helps track which hashtags and content resonate with your local audience. For example, if you use a hashtag like #CharlotteEvents, you can track how much engagement this gets from users in that city and refine your content strategy to include more relevant, local-specific topics or promotions.\n\n\n\nConducting a local SEO audit\n\n\n\nA local SEO audit can help assess the effectiveness of your optimization efforts. By evaluating the key metrics for local SEO success, like organic traffic, engagement, and local search rankings, you can identify areas for improvement and ensure your event's visibility stays strong. Use this list of questions to easily conduct an audit on the quality of your event\u2019s SEO:\n\n\n\n\nAre your event name, date, time, location, and ticket information consistent across all platforms (website, event listing sites, Google Business Profile, social media, etc.)?\n\n\n\nAre you using local and event-specific keywords? For example, \u201cNashville music events,\u201d \u201cconcerts near me,\u201d or \u201cupcoming rock concerts in Nashville\u201d.\n\n\n\nIs your Google Business Profile (GBP) set up and fully optimized with the correct event details? Are you posting regular updates to this profile about ticket sales, new speakers, event news, etc.?\n\n\n\nIs your event website mobile-friendly? Does it load quickly and display correctly on mobile devices?\n\n\n\nAre you listed in local event directories (e.g., Songkick for concerts and local tourism boards) and receiving backlinks from local blogs, businesses, or news outlets?\n\n\n\nAre you using location-based hashtags and geotags on your social media posts? Are you interacting with local influencers and event-goers?\n\n\n\nAre people leaving reviews about your event on Google, Facebook, or Yelp? Are you encouraging attendees to post photos, videos, and testimonials?\n\n\n\nAre you tracking how your event is performing in local searches? Tools like Google Search Console and Google Analytics can show you search rankings, traffic sources, and user behavior.\n\n\n\nHave you implemented event schema markup on your event webpage? This structured data helps search engines understand your event\u2019s details better.\n\n\n\n\nMake local SEO work for your event\n\n\n\nLocal SEO is a super affordable and effective way to attract more attendees, boost ticket sales, and ensure your event gets the attention it deserves. By optimizing your Google Business Profile, website, event listings, and social media presence, you can increase your event\u2019s visibility and maximize attendance!

Unfortunately, this could also make you a target for cybercriminals. Whenever emails, personal data, and financial information are involved (like having online accounts or selling tickets to your events), phishing attacks are a potential danger to be aware of. But don\u2019t worry! Our team is here to equip you with practical tips to protect yourself, your team, and your attendees from phishing attacks.\n\n\n\nWhat is phishing?\n\n\n\nPhishing is a type of cybercrime in which scammers attempt to trick users into sharing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. They'll pretend to be someone trustworthy, like a well-known brand or even your event itself, and ask people to complete an action (e.g., clicking a link, verify your account information) that ultimately leaks sensitive data to them.\n\n\n\nPhishing attacks happen through various methods, like sending emails, phone calls, texts, and social media messages. When it comes to events, a scammer may pretend to be your ticketing provider, ask you to reenter your password, and get you to click a link with malicious code. They may even pose as your event to try to sell fake event tickets to people. Recognizing these tactics is key to staying protected!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should event organizers be aware of phishing?\n\n\n\nIf you're an event organizer, it\u2019s essential that you educate yourself on how to avoid phishing attacks. This is because you're handling sensitive data like names, emails, financial details, or even addresses as you make money from revenue streams like ticket sales, donations, and merch. Luckily, if you're with a secure ticketing solution like TicketLeap, that data is safe with us!\n\n\n\nHowever, you still have to be on the look out for bad actors pretending to be your ticketing platform in an attempt to gain access to your account's login information and exploit the data once they're inside. If you're not careful, phishing attacks can interrupt your ticket sales, compromise people's personal or financial information, hurt your reputation, or even lead to identity theft. Educating yourself, your team, and your attendees about phishing is critical to ensuring everyone stays safe!\n\n\n\nWhat types of phishing should ticket buyers look out for?\n\n\n\nIf you're an attendee, be on the look out for phishing schemes like a fake email masquerading as an event you're planning to attend or wanting to buy tickets to. The more well-known the event, the more likely phishing attempts like ticket scams are possible. As a general rule, always purchase from the event's official website and communicate with their team directly.\n\n\n\nHow to identify phishing attacks\n\n\n\nCatch phishing scams before they catch you! Here are the red flags of suspicious emails to watch out for.\n\n\n\n1. Incorrect sender email address\n\n\n\nAlways double check the \u201cFrom\u201d address and \u201cReply-To\u201d fields in an email. Phishing emails might use a fake reply address that doesn't match the original sender's \u201cFrom\u201d email address. If these don\u2019t match, that\u2019s a sign the email is likely illegitimate. Scammers will often also create addresses that look legitimate but contain subtle variations, like using extra punctuation, hyphens, or misspelled domain names. For example, they may replace an \u201co\u201d with \u201c0\u201d or use \u201cr\u201d and \u201cn\u201d instead of a \u201cm\u201d.\n\n\n\nAs we mention in this help article, if you ever get an email from TicketLeap, the email will always be from @ticketleap.com, @ticketleap.events, or @leapevent.tech. Any other email alterations (e.g., ticketleap@gmail.com or info@ticket-leap.com) are from scammers. When in doubt, reach out to our team at contactus@ticketleap.com!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Suspicious links or attachments\n\n\n\nHover your mouse over any links in emails to see where they\u2019ll actually take you before clicking. When in doubt, don't click it! Phishing links may look like they lead to a trusted site but instead direct you to a fake webpage designed to steal your credentials. Likewise, avoid downloading unexpected attachments or engaging with unexpected pop ups \u2014 they could contain malware!\n\n\n\n3. Urgent language\n\n\n\nBe wary of emails that pressure you with urgency to take some immediate action on your account, like \u201cYour account has been locked! Act now to restore it.\u201d When an email asks you to take unexpected actions like reentering your password or verifying your account details, think before you click! While a legitimate company may send these kinds of emails to help you secure your account, make sure you double check the sender\u2019s email (e.g., @ticketleap.com) and the links before moving forward. When you get messages like this, it's a good idea to verify this email through official channels (e.g., by contacting the company directly using a trusted contact method) before taking any action.\n\n\n\n4. Spelling and grammatical errors\n\n\n\nLook out for emails riddled with awkward phrasing, spelling issues, or grammatical mistakes. Another red flag? The language of the email is rather generic. Reputable organizations take care to ensure their communication is professional and error-free.\n\n\n\nPhishing Email Examples\n\n\n\nFor an event organizer, a fake email may look like this one below. Someone is pretending to be TicketLeap, asking you for a refund, but in reality they want you to click a malicious link. Notice how the link is not even our ticketleap.events link, and when you hover over it, it takes you somewhere completely different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ticket buyers, be cautious of phishing emails that appear to come from the actual event but are actual fake emails designed to steal your personal information. These scams might ask you to \"confirm your payment details,\" click on a link to \"retrieve your tickets,\" or provide login credentials to access your account. Be wary of urgent language, unfamiliar email addresses, or attachments, as these are common red flags in phishing attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to protect your business from phishing scams\n\n\n\nWant to know the secret on how to prevent phishing attacks? Stay proactive! Here are six security habits that'll ensure your events stay protected:\n\n\n\n1. Use secure passwords\n\n\n\nShort passwords are a thing of the past! Opt for long, random strings of text (more than 16 characters) with mixed-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider pass-phrases like \u201cGiraffeBaristaCoffeeDragon!\u201d with 4-7 unrelated words strung together into a memorable phrase. Make sure you use unique passwords - don't reuse your passwords for multiple accounts! We don't expect you to remember all of them though. Use a password manager like 1Password, Dashlane, or NordPass to store them all so you only have to remember one master password!\n\n\n\n2. Set up two-factor authentication\n\n\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection to your account, requiring both a password and a time-sensitive verification code sent to an external device via a phone number or authenticator app. This should be set up on all your accounts that provide this option, especially those with access to sensitive business data, such as emails and banking account numbers. This includes your TicketLeap account! As you can learn about in this help article, we offer this feature to ensure your data stays secure with us.\n\n\n\n3. Never provide personal information to unverified sources\n\n\n\nA good rule of thumb: If you did not initiate the conversation, you very likely shouldn't provide them with any sensitive or confidential information. This includes passwords, account numbers, and your social security number. Even if the email looks real, most companies will not ask for this type of information in this way. When in doubt, contact the organization or event organizer themselves to verify if this message is legitimate. You should also log into your online accounts directly through their website rather than clicking the links provided.\n\n\n\n4. Educate your team and attendees\n\n\n\nFor event organizers, make phishing awareness part of your training process when hiring new staff. Additionally, share tips and resources with your attendees (like this blog!) through email or social media to inform them about the danger of phishing attacks. When selling your tickets online, clearly state what the link to your ticketing page is (such as ticketleap.events) and anything else is incorrect. It could also help to have information on your website to clarify that tickets are only valid when purchased directly from your website, and not from a third party.\n\n\n\n5. Keep your computer updated and protected\n\n\n\nInstall anti-virus software to fill any security patches and provide an extra barrier from malicious files. Always make sure this stays updated, and make sure to keep your web browsers up-to-date too! It's also best that you don't save any passwords and other sensitive data (e.g., credit cards, addresses) directly in your browser, but instead store them in your password manager as an extension on your browser.\n\n\n\n6. Report suspicious emails\n\n\n\nThe moment you catch any phishing emails or suspect suspicious activity, report it! Don\u2019t open links or download any attachments. Instead, mark the emails as spam, delete them, and (when possible) alert the company affiliated with that request through another form of communication. For example, if you were to receive any suspicious requests that appear to be from TicketLeap, contact our support team to verify the request or to confirm that it's actually from one of many known phishing sites.\n\n\n\nWhat to do if your account gets compromised\n\n\n\nIf you're a victim of a phishing attack, you'll need to act quickly to restore your accounts. Here are vital steps for you to take:\n\n\n\n\nNotify the company of your compromised account. You need to also notify your IT team if this attack is affiliated with work or school-related accounts.\n\n\n\nUpdate all your passwords on any affected accounts, plus any additional accounts that use the same password.\n\n\n\nSet up two-factor authentication on your accounts if you haven't already.\n\n\n\nRecord as many details as you can about the phishing attack (This will be important for reporting purposes later, especially if law enforcement needs to get involved).\n\n\n\nIf you lost money or face identity theft because of the phishing attack, report it to your local law enforcement and share the details you recorded.\n\n\n\n\nWondering if you've been successfully phished? Here are the signs to look out for:\n\n\n\n\nUnable to log into your accounts\n\n\n\nAbnormal charges to your bank account\n\n\n\nStrange accounts appearing on your monthly statements or credit report\n\n\n\nDenial of your credit card\n\n\n\n\nIf you think your TicketLeap account was compromised, contact TicketLeap\u2019s support team as soon as possible and we\u2019ll work with you to restore your account!\n\n\n\nHow TicketLeap helps you avoid phishing scams\n\n\n\nWhen event organizers use TicketLeap to sell their tickets, they can have peace of mind that they're in safe hands! When it comes to handling your payment information or your ticket buyers' financial information, we use Stripe, an industry-leading payment processor for maximum data security.

Thinking you could use a little help? Enter artificial intelligence \u2014 the new secret weapon for event planners. From generating creative ideas to streamlining logistics, AI tools are making it easier than ever for event organizers to plan successful events without breaking a sweat. In this article, we\u2019ll explore how using AI for event planning can save you time, boost your creativity, and make your process more efficient. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n\n\nBenefits of AI in event planning\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is all about using smart technology to handle tasks that usually are done by humans (like problem solving and decision making). In the event industry, AI can help with everything from managing schedules to giving you fresh ideas.\n\n\n\nFor event organizers, AI is a game changer! It helps save time and cut costs by automating things like ticketing, marketing, and scheduling. In return, this gives you more freedom to focus on the fun and creative aspects of your event. Plus, AI is a great tool for brainstorming and fine-tuning ideas, offering fresh perspectives when you\u2019re stuck. That said, while AI is an incredible helper, it\u2019s your creativity and vision that should always be at the heart of your event planning!\n\n\n\nAI tools for event planning\n\n\n\nAI can be a powerful ally in simplifying many areas of your event planning. Here\u2019s how this technology can assist through different stages of your journey:\n\n\n\nEvent concept and theme development\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to brainstorming creative event concepts, AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper can really come in handy. These tools can generate unique event ideas based on factors like your target audience, season, or budget constraints. For instance, if you\u2019re planning a summer community fair, you can prompt AI to suggest themes that combine outdoor fun and family-friendly activities.\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed down a concept, Canva\u2019s Magic Design can take it a step further by helping you design your visual assets. Whether you need a logo, color palette, or mood board to convey your event\u2019s aesthetic, Canva will generate customizable templates that align with your event theme. This is super useful for organizers looking to maintain a cohesive brand without hiring a professional designer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket sales\n\n\n\nSelling tickets is one of the most crucial parts of event planning, and AI paired with a user-friendly ticketing platform like TicketLeap can make it a whole lot easier. Need help writing a captivating event description or creating speaker bios? Tools like ChatGPT got you covered. You can even quickly generate an FAQ section to add to your event website that answers common questions attendees might have. Plus, using AI-powered SEO tools like SurferSEO ensures your content ranks well on search engines.\n\n\n\nIf you need more event content,(like photos to promote a first-time event), AI photo generators like DALL\u00b7E can create a polished header image that fits your theme perfectly. An AI tool can also help you find that sweet spot for ticket prices by analyzing similar events and market trends, making sure your pricing is competitive and appealing to your audience.\n\n\n\nMarketing and promotion\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting the word out, AI can supercharge your marketing efforts. Tools like HubSpot AI and Writesonic are great for crafting catchy social media posts and launching email campaigns that grab your readers\u2019 attention. Whether you\u2019re promoting a community festival or a workshop, these tools can help tailor your messaging to your audience, making your content even more intriguing to them.\n\n\n\nNeed to spread the word even further? AI can also assist in drafting a professional press release to announce your event. Plus, digital ad platforms like Meta Ads use AI tools like Meta Advantage to help you create targeted ad campaigns, ensuring your event reaches the right people and maximizes your event budget.\n\n\n\nAttendee engagement\n\n\n\nWanting to really elevate your experience? Recruit AI tools to better engage with your guests. For instance, tools like Mailchimp\u2019s AI features can personalize attendee communications. You can tailor email campaigns based on guest preferences or behaviors, ensuring every attendee feels valued.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a unique way to engage your attendees?&nbsp; Create and customize interactive games with Rosebud AI for them to play! Level up your experience with a trivia challenge or a themed game tied to your event!\n\n\n\nIf your event needs the perfect soundtrack, AI can help there too! Spotify\u2019s DJ feature can curate playlists based on your event\u2019s theme and audience preferences, setting the right mood from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 practical prompts when using AI for event planning in ChatGPT\n\n\n\nThe secret to getting the best results with AI lies in crafting quality prompts. The more specific you are, the better AI can deliver exactly what you need. Here are a few practical examples to help you get started, plus a few tips for refining your prompts in ChatGPT or other AI chatbots.\n\n\n\n1. Prompt for social media content\n\n\n\nA basic prompt might generate you a generic social media post, but adding more details can transform the output into something truly engaging. Instead of just asking AI for social media captions, make sure to mention relevant keywords you want to include, specify the tone you want (e.g., playful, professional, quirky), and define your target audience. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n\n\n\u201cGenerate 5 Instagram captions for a winter-themed craft fair that includes the keyword \u2018handmade gifts\u2019, uses a playful tone, and targets families with young children.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. Prompt for generating an event email\n\n\n\nWant to send a buzzworthy event email? Give AI clear instructions of what you\u2019re looking for. Be sure to mention your preferred style, the essential details of your event (e.g., date, time, location), and what action you want recipients to take, like in this prompt:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWrite an event invitation email for a summer music festival called \"Sunset Sounds.\" Include a headline, the event date (July 15), location (Oceanview Park, California), and highlights such as live performances, local food trucks, and a beer garden. End with a call to action encouraging early ticket purchases. Use a friendly, conversational tone.\u201d\n\n\n\n3. Prompt for scheduling and logistics\n\n\n\nFor creating detailed timelines or schedules, the more context, the better. Be sure to include all the important details like location, activities, and duration of each session. As needed, you should also mention budget constraints or any special considerations (like noise curfews).\n\n\n\n\u201cCreate a timeline for a one-day music festival in Central Park with three live performances, food trucks, and a craft market. The target audience is young adults, and the event officially starts at 11AM before wrapping up by 10PM. Account for at least two hours of set-up and tear-down time.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. Prompt for event description\n\n\n\nA good event description should be concise yet engaging, highlighting the must-know details and setting the tone for your event. When creating your prompt, include specifics like the event\u2019s purpose, audience, key features, and an action you want readers to take. Try this prompt:\n\n\n\n\u201cWrite a 150-word event description for a fall harvest festival designed for families. Highlight key features like hayrides, pumpkin picking, live music, and local food vendors. Emphasize the festive, family-friendly atmosphere and include a call-to-action encouraging readers to buy tickets early to save their spot.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. Prompt for designing an event logo\n\n\n\nWhen prompting AI for a logo design, be clear about the style, colors, and key elements that represent your event. Providing a brief description of the event\u2019s theme or vibe will also help create a more relevant design:\n\n\n\n\u201cDesign a logo for a charity 5K run called \u2018Run for Hope.\u2019 The event supports local cancer research. Use a minimalist style, shades of blue to symbolize hope, and incorporate a running shoe icon to reflect the event\u2019s focus.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. Prompt for brainstorming event themes\n\n\n\nNeed some creative inspiration for your next event\u2019s theme? To get the most creative and relevant theme ideas, include details about your audience, event type, and desired atmosphere. Get specific with your request:\n\n\n\n\u201cGenerate five theme ideas for a corporate holiday party hosted by a financial firm. The event should balance a formal atmosphere with a fun, engaging twist, appeal to a professional audience, and include elements like festive d\u00e9cor and interactive activities.\u201d\n\n\n\n7. Prompt for writing an event press release\n\n\n\nCrafting a press release? For an effective press release, your prompt should include the event\u2019s purpose, key highlights, quotes from organizers or stakeholders, and any critical information like where to buy tickets or who all is part of your lineup. A clear tone (e.g., professional or enthusiastic) ensures the AI matches your intended style.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWrite a press release announcing the inaugural \u2018Art in the Square\u2019 community festival, a celebration of local artists and performers taking place on September 15 at Central Plaza. Highlight featured artists such as painter Mia Thompson, sculptor Alex Rivera, and musician The Harmony Trio. Include a quote from the organizer, Sarah Lee, stating, \u201cArt in the Square is all about bringing our community together to support and celebrate the incredible talent we have right here in our backyard.\u201d Mention that tickets are $10 for general admission, with early bird pricing of $8 available until August 31. Tickets can be purchased on their website through TicketLeap. Use a professional yet enthusiastic tone to engage readers and generate excitement.\u201d\n\n\n\nLimitations and ethical use of AI\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile AI is a powerful tool for event planning, it\u2019s essential to remember that it should complement your creativity and not replace it. AI can help streamline tasks and provide ideas, but the heart of your event needs to come from your personal vision! Overrelying on AI can lead to inaccuracies, biases, or generic content, so it\u2019s important to review and refine its outputs to ensure they align with your goals. Plus, you may think of ideas and solutions that AI never would!\n\n\n\nWhen using AI, always be cautious with confidential information. For example, avoid sharing sensitive data like attendee lists or financial details. Ethical use of AI is key, so ensure the content it generates is inclusive, respectful, and accurate. With the right balance, AI can be an invaluable resource, but channeling your creativity makes your event truly unique!\n\n\n\nReady to supercharge your event planning?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAI is a powerful assistant for event organizers, offering many opportunities to simplify tasks, enhance creativity, and boost efficiency. With the right tools, you can focus more on the details while AI handles the outline of your event planning process! Remember, the key is to use AI as a tool to supplement your unique vision.Want to make your event planning even easier?

Set up archery games using foam or inflatable bow-and-arrow sets so attendees can literally \u201caim for their goals.\u201d Create a giant dartboard where guests can write their New Year\u2019s resolutions on colorful sticky notes, pin them to the board, and take turns aiming for their targets with soft-tip darts. To keep the theme consistent, consider a Robin Hood-inspired d\u00e9cor like using green and earthy tones, faux wood accents, and banners with archery targets as decorations.\n\n\n\nTip: Sell goal-setting kits (including pens and paper templates) along with your tickets!\n\n\n\n5. A blast from the past&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA time-traveling theme is always a crowd-pleaser! Invite guests to dress from different time periods \u2014 past, present, and future. Incorporate futuristic d\u00e9cor with LED lights, while offering nostalgic elements from past decades like retro technology and vintage candy. Project famous moments from history onto the walls in different rooms where attendees can walk through for a more immersive experience.\n\n\n\nTip: Use your event management software to simplify check-ins with a QR code scan at the door!\n\n\n\n6. Phoenix soiree&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTransform the night with a \u201cPhoenix Soir\u00e9e\u201d party, symbolizing renewal and rebirth. Set the mood with a fiery color palette of reds and oranges for your decorations, and hire a fire performer or hand out sparklers as unique entertainment for your guests. Have a table-top fireplace where attendees can roast marshmallows, and encourage guests to write down what they want to leave behind and burn it at midnight to help bring healing.\n\n\n\nTip: Use your event ticketing system to allow attendees to register for sparklers and marshmallow kits in advance, ensuring you have enough supplies for everyone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n7. Roaring twenties\n\n\n\nTake your guests back to the glitz and glamor of the 1920s! Encourage flapper dresses and tuxedos for the attire. Offer a champagne tower to bring in the New Year in style and to serve as a stunning centerpiece as guests arrive. A live jazz band can immerse guests into the era, while a vintage photo booth captures the fun! You can elevate your atmosphere even more by setting up a speakeasy-style cocktail bar with classic 1920s drinks like sidecars and French 75s, giving guests a taste of Prohibition-era indulgence. To add an element of surprise, consider hosting a Charleston dance-off!\n\n\n\nTip: Create tiered ticketing options for this upscale event, including VIP packages with access to additional perks like free cocktails or photo booth tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Stars align&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn astrology and zodiac-themed party is sure to enchant your attendees. Use zodiac-inspired d\u00e9cor like table centerpieces featuring each astrological sign's symbols or zodiac constellation backdrops, and offer tarot card readings or astrological predictions as entertainment. For an otherworldly touch, add themed lighting with starry projections to truly impress attendees.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTip: Use your ticketing platform to offer add-ons like personal astrology readings, where attendees can pre-book a session at the event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9. All that glitters is gold&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor a more luxurious New Year\u2019s Eve, host an \u201cAll That Glitters is Gold\u201d party. Start by setting the scene with gold tablecloths, shimmering metallic streamers, and a statement backdrop of large, gold foil balloons that spell out the year. For an interactive touch, create a gold-themed photo booth complete with gold sequin backdrops and oversized golden props like crowns. As for drinks, offer gold-themed cocktails like a sparkling champagne punch with gold sugar-rimmed glasses or martinis topped with edible gold flakes. For the grand finale, plan a dramatic gold balloon release at midnight \u2014 fill the ceiling with balloons ready to cascade down as the clock strikes twelve!\n\n\n\nTip: Your event software can help by sending digital \u201cgolden tickets\u201d to guests, offering exclusive access to premium areas or experiences within your event.\n\n\n\n10. Blossoming beginnings\n\n\n\nCreate a serene atmosphere with this floral theme. Set up a bloom wall where guests can pin their written hopes and dreams for the new year on paper flowers. Consider offering flower crowns as party favors. You can either pre-make them using fresh or faux flowers, or set up a do-it-yourself flower crown station where guests can create their own crowns using a mix of blooms, leaves, and ribbons. As a nice touch, serve floral-infused cocktails or mocktails like lavender lemonade or rosewater spritzers.\n\n\n\nTip: Create a giveaway contest where attendees can post photos with their crowns using your branded hashtag for a chance to win future event tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Wishing upon a new year\n\n\n\nSet up a whimsical wishing well at your event, where guests can toss coins and make a wish for the new year. Be sure to include a setup where guests can grab a coin in case they don\u2019t have one! For an added touch, include a wishing tree, where guests can hang their wishes. Offer metallic pens and paper for guests to add some flair to their wishes.\n\n\n\nTip: With your ticketing software, set up a donation option where attendees can donate to a charity with every wish, combining good deeds with the magic of the night.\n\n\n\n12. New Year kickoff&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnite the sports fans in your community with this theme where the spirit of competition and celebration collide! Encourage guests to wear their favorite team jerseys or dress as iconic athletes from any sport. Think basketball uniforms, football helmets, or even tennis skirts. Set the tone by decorating your space with team flags, pennants, and inflatable sports gear (e.g., soccer balls and footballs) to create a true stadium atmosphere. You could organize a flip-cup tournament on a table covered with a green \u201cfield\u201d tablecloth, marked with yard lines to mimic a football field. For a unique twist, create a marble race track inspired by NASCAR, using long cardboard tubes decorated like a racetrack, where guests can race marbles to the finish line.\n\n\n\nTip: Utilize event reminder emails through your ticketing platform with fun messaging like \u201cGear up for the big day!\u201d to get your attendees excited for the upcoming big kickoff!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Keep swimming into the new year\n\n\n\nInspired by Disney\u2019s Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, this under-the-sea party includes blue lights, jellyfish lanterns, and ocean-inspired food and drinks. Set up a \u201cDeep Dive\u201d memory lane activity where guests can reflect on their favorite moments of the past year. Create a display wall or table with seashell-shaped notecards where attendees can write down their most memorable experiences from the past year too. Attach these cards to fishing nets or pin them onto a large \u201creef\u201d board for everyone to read and reminisce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTip: Link an animated video or looped clip of floating bubbles and shimmering lights to create a mesmerizing underwater effect on your event ticketing landing page!\n\n\n\n14. Red carpet&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoll out the red carpet and let your attendees live out their celebrity dreams! Have a paparazzi photo booth, upscale food and drinks, and a chance for attendees to dress as their favorite stars. As guests arrive, have a \u201cpaparazzi photo booth\u201d waiting for them at the end of the carpet, complete with flashing camera lights, faux photographers, and a branded backdrop featuring your event name and logo! Consider giving out awards for the best dressed or best celebrity resemblance to mimic an award show.\n\n\n\nTip: Allow VIP ticket holders early entry with exclusive access to the \u201cgreen room,\u201d where they can enjoy extra perks like champagne and hors d'oeuvres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Glam and give back gala&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnd the year on a charitable note with a New Year\u2019s Eve fundraising gala! Guests can dress to impress, while live updates on donation goals motivate people to give more to your cause. You can make your event more interactive by setting milestone goals. For example, when you hit a certain donation mark, announce a special activity or surprise like an additional performance, a champagne toast, or a raffle prize. To inspire your attendees, invite a guest speaker who\u2019s either directly involved with the cause you\u2019re supporting or someone with a powerful story that resonates with your event's theme. Be sure to decorate your event with bright metallics and fun New Year photo backdrops to get your guests excited for the new year!\n\n\n\nTip: Utilize your event software\u2019s donation feature to easily track donations so you can encourage higher contributions throughout the night!\n\n\n\nNew Years Eve party decoration ideas\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s explore some fun decor options that will elevate your New Year\u2019s Eve celebration and leave your attendees in awe!\n\n\n\n1. Balloon drop&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInflate balloons and place them in a large net or plastic tablecloth, secured to the ceiling with strong tape, leaving one side untaped for release. Attach a string to the loose side of the net, which will be pulled to release the balloons at the desired moment. Test the drop beforehand to ensure everything goes smoothly, and consider adding confetti or streamers for extra flair! When the clock strikes midnight, simply pull the string to let the balloons cascade down as attendees celebrate.\n\n\n\n2. Light up dance floor&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo build a light-up dance floor, assemble a wooden or acrylic base to serve as the floor's foundation, ensuring it\u2019s sturdy and smooth. Install LED strip lights or fairy lights beneath transparent or frosted acrylic panels, spacing them evenly for uniform lighting. Secure the panels to the base and connect the lights to a power source, preferably with a remote or dimmer for easy control. Add reflective or metallic tape around the edges for extra shine, and test the lights before the event to ensure they\u2019re ready for your dance party.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Disco champagne bowls and glasses\n\n\n\nBegin by purchasing plain champagne bowls or glasses, plus some small mirrored tiles or adhesive mirror mosaic stickers (like those on a disco ball!). Clean and dry the glasses, then apply the mirrored tiles around the base or stem, working your way up as desired, to mimic the look of a disco ball. Ensure the mirrors are evenly spaced and secure, using glue as needed to keep them in place. Let them dry completely, then polish the glasses to remove any smudges, leaving you with dazzling, disco-inspired drinkware perfect for a party.\n\n\n\n4. Champagne tower display\n\n\n\nTo start, place a sturdy tray or platform on a flat surface. Arrange champagne glasses in a square formation, beginning with the largest base layer, ensuring they touch each other. Stack additional layers by placing glasses directly on the gaps between the glasses below, forming a pyramid shape. Typically, four layers work well, but you can adjust based on height preference. Once stacked, carefully pour champagne into the top glass, allowing it to overflow and cascade into the layers below. You can even surround the tower with gold confetti and LED lights to enhance your stunning display!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Countdown balloon garland&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlow up balloons of various sizes and colors, then tie them together using a balloon strip or fishing line.&nbsp; For the countdown, tape large number decals to clear balloons to represent the new year. Layer the balloons, adjusting sizes for depth and texture. Attach the garland to a wall or backdrop using command hooks or tape. For extra flair, add metallic fringe or smaller balloons in between the larger ones to create a full, festive look.\n\n\n\n6. Light displays\n\n\n\nHang twinkling string lights across ceilings, walls, and around entrance ways to transform the space into a magical setting. Use LED candles for a soft, flickering glow without the risk of fire hazards. You can even incorporate lighted marquee numbers or letters that spell out the new year, creating a stunning photo backdrop for your guests.\n\n\n\n7. Confetti cannon\n\n\n\nTo make a large confetti cannon, start with a cardboard tube (like a mailing tube) or PVC pipe, ensuring it's about 2-3 feet long. Fill it with confetti, leaving some space at the top. Use colors that align with your party theme, such as gold for a Gatsby-inspired event or a metallic mix for a fun, sparkly vibe. Seal one end with a cap or tape, and at the other end, create a burst mechanism by using a balloon or tissue paper. To do this, stretch the balloon over the end. When ready to use, pull the balloon to release the confetti with a pop! \u200b\u200bDon\u2019t forget to have a camera ready to capture the moment as the confetti flies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Balloon countdown wall&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArrange balloons in a large display numbered from 10 to 1, corresponding with the countdown to the new year. For each second of the countdown, pop the balloon to get everyone excited. Use a mix of metallic and confetti-filled balloons for a more dramatic effect when they burst, creating a visual pop with each countdown moment.\n\n\n\nTime to welcome in the new year!\n\n\n\nAs the clock strikes midnight and the new year unfolds, the right New Year\u2019s Eve party ideas and decorations can set the stage for a truly unforgettable celebration.

On top of being the perfect sweater weather, the season offers endless opportunities to try unique winter party themes that help you celebrate. Whether it\u2019s a formal gathering or something more laid-back, a thoughtful theme will make your event stand out! Here are a few winter-themed party ideas to get your creative juices flowing \u2014 and some super helpful tips along the way of how event ticketing software can streamline the planning process!\n\n\n\n1. Winter wonderland\n\n\n\nTransform your venue into a frosty winter wonderland with snowflake garlands, fake snow, and shimmering icicle string lights. For an added \"wow\" factor, place an ice sculpture as the stunning centerpiece to greet guests as they arrive. To keep everyone warm, set up a hot chocolate bar stocked with marshmallows and an array of flavored syrups. If you're using an event ticketing platform like TicketLeap, you can even include custom questions at checkout, allowing guests to pre-select their favorite hot chocolate toppings and notify your team of any dietary restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Apr\u00e8s ski lodge\n\n\n\nGo for a cozy alpine vibe with faux fur blankets, wooden accents, and string lights. A hot toddy or mulled wine station will keep things warm, while a mini \u201cski slope\u201d photo backdrop adds a fun activity for your attendees. You can even encourage guests to show up in their best ski gear to snap some funny photos with their fellow ski-enthusiast friends! For a seamless experience, offer multiple ticket types, such as general admission and VIP with a complimentary drink included.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Polar Express party\n\n\n\nInspired by the classic holiday movie Polar Express, transform your event space with long tables adorned with lanterns and serve hot cocoa in festive mugs. Keep the cozy vibe going by playing this classic movie in the background to set the perfect mood this holiday season. Invite your guests to come dressed in their favorite holiday pajamas, and consider giving out a sleigh bell to each of them as a party favor at the end. To simplify event planning, consider offering different ticket options for adults and kids, or bundle hot cocoa with the ticket price for a seamless experience once your guests arrive!\n\n\n\n4. Snow globe party\n\n\n\nCreate an intimate, magical setting with a snow globe theme. As far as winter party decoration ideas, clear and white balloons, fairy lights, and white fabric will give your venue the perfect snow globe feel, plus plush chairs and blankets to keep it cozy. The best part? Hand out mini snow globes as party favors so guests have a keepsake, or even have the needed craft supplies ready for your guests to build a snow globe of their own. To make things super simple, use an event ticketing platform to track RSVPs and manage limited seating for this smaller, intimate gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Fire and ice\n\n\n\nFor a dramatic, contrasting theme, go with a \u201cFire and Ice\u201d party! Set up separate areas with fire pits for warmth and ice bars for chilling drinks. Serve spicy food on the \u201cfire\u201d side and ice cream or chilled cocktails on the \u201cice\u201d side. You can even add a nostalgic touch to this theme by adding references to the Snow and Heat Miser from the classic film The Year Without a Santa Claus. Don\u2019t forget about entertainment! Fire dancers and ice sculptors can be a great choice for this theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Holiday masquerade ball\n\n\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a bit of mystery? Perfect for an upscale holiday event, a masquerade ball with winter-inspired masks combines a sense of mystery and elegance. Set the scene with chandeliers, glitter, and candlelight, and encourage your attendees to wear formal attire. To add a fun competitive edge, offer prizes for the best masks. For a super polished look, a branded event page could help you set the tone early, allowing guests to see all the event details (like location or dress code) and purchase tickets to your event directly from your page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Arctic adventure\n\n\n\nInvite guests on an Arctic Adventure with decor inspired by polar bears, penguins, and icebergs. Add cotton snow and educational signs about arctic wildlife to make this theme more unique. Incorporating a lively photo booth with arctic animal cutouts will surely make for unforgettable snapshots! Also, make sure to have activities that tie into the theme, such as a \"find the hidden polar bear\" scavenger hunt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Ice palace\n\n\n\nLooking to host a glamorous winter event? Go with an ice palace theme featuring icy blues, crystals, and frosted accents! To get the most out of your decor, dim the lights to create a sparkling ambiance. Consider hosting a contest of your choice that chooses an ice palace king and queen towards the end of the event! To add an elegant touch, ice-themed cocktails or mocktails served in frosted glasses with winter berries will do just the trick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Hot cocoa bar\u00a0\n\n\n\nEmbrace ultimate comfort and warmth with a hot cocoa Bar party! Let your attendees customize their drinks with a delicious array of toppings like whipped cream, peppermint sticks, chocolate chips, and even flavored syrups. To enhance the cozy atmosphere, create inviting seating areas with fuzzy blankets and pillows, ideally around a crackling fireplace or outdoor heaters to keep everyone toasty. You can also offer spiked hot cocoa options for adult guests to add a fun twist to this traditional favorite.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Winter solstice celebration\n\n\n\nCelebrate the longest night of the year with a winter solstice themed party. If you\u2019re in an area where you can use natural elements like evergreens or pine cones, these would be perfect party decorations. Low lighting creates an intimate atmosphere, while mulled cider and a fire pit help honor the return of light! Consider having an activity like writing positive wishes for the new year on small pieces of paper and sticking it in the nooks of a pine cone to be tossed in a fire!&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n11. Christmas movie marathon\n\n\n\nSet up a cozy Christmas movie marathon with plenty of blankets, popcorn, and holiday-themed snacks. For fans of Christmas movies, this may just be the best winter party idea yet! Set up a snack bar where guests can choose from festive treats, like Christmas cracker candy or gingerbread muffins. With a ticketing software like TicketLeap, you can send out a survey beforehand to gauge what movies your attendees love so you can include them in your marathon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Winter carnival\n\n\n\nBring the fun of a carnival into the winter season with games, food trucks or catering, and festive booths. Traditional carnival games like ring toss and balloon darts can be given a wintery twist with snowball throwing or snowman bowling. And what\u2019s a carnival without food? Station food carts around your venue that serve cotton candy, popcorn, or hot pretzels to give your attendees delicious treats to enjoy as they check out your attractions. This winter party theme works really well for large outdoor community events, where multiple ticket options (family passes or individual tickets) can streamline entry to your event!\n\n\n\n13. Cozy cabin\u00a0\n\n\n\nGoing for a rustic and relaxed vibe? Turn your event into a cozy cabin with this winter party theme! Use plaid blankets, wooden accents, and fire pits to create an inviting space. S\u2019mores-making kits and mulled cider are great refreshments that reinforce this relaxed setting. Whether this is a small or large gathering, consider adding some ice breaker activities or small games like an indoor scavenger hunt to engage your guests with each other.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n14. Gingerbread house competition\n\n\n\nTons of cookies and some friendly competition? Yes please! Host a gingerbread house contest where your attendees compete to build the most creative, festive houses. Provide pre-assembled gingerbread kits with candies and icing for decoration. Think about adding categories like \"Most Creative\" or \"Best Structure\" so there can be multiple winners. To help make the competition run smoothly, make managing event registration super easy by setting up different entry types for teams or individuals in your event ticketing system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Winter olympics\n\n\n\nA Winter Olympics theme is perfect for incorporating fun winter sports like ice skating, snowball fights, or sledding. Set up mini competitions with medals or trophies for the winners. You can manage team registrations through your ticketing platform and include questions in your checkout process like t-shirt size for custom jerseys for each team. Be sure to have refreshments to keep your olympians energized and hydrated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n16. Snowman-making contest\n\n\n\nBring out everyone's creativity with a snowman-making contest! If you\u2019re located in an area with natural snow, this is a perfect outdoor event; otherwise, make sure you\u2019re stocked up on artificial snow so guests have all they need! Provide guests with snowman-building materials like scarves, hats, and buttons. Have you ever heard of snow painting? Add some stations with multiple spray bottles mixed with food coloring for a fun addition. To make things easier, use ticketing software to manage entry fees and provide details on what materials will be available or what guests should bring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17. Winter white party\n\n\n\nThis event theme is about embracing an all-white dress code and decor to create a sophisticated, cohesive look and celebrate the winter season. For winter party decoration ideas, think white flowers, crisp linens, and sparkling candles to set the tone for a refined atmosphere. Really want to embrace this theme? Adding a white wine-tasting activity to your event will surely engage your guests! Elevate the experience with white-themed treats like coconut macaroons, vanilla cupcakes, or even a white chocolate fondue fountain for guests to enjoy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n18. Frosted fairy tale\n\n\n\nTransport attendees into a whimsical world with this event theme! Decorate with twinkling lights, faux snow, and woodland creature props. Soft pastel colors like lavender, pale blue, and silver will combine frost and fairies perfectly! Hand out fairy wings or crowns to guests to tie into the theme. Maybe even host a game throughout the duration of your event to see who can find the mini silver magic wand and win prizes or tickets to your next event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Ugly sweater party\n\n\n\nThis casual, fun theme invites guests to wear their tackiest holiday sweaters! Make it competitive by offering prizes for categories like \u201cMost Creative\u201d or \u201cMost Hideous\u201d. To grab some hilarious snapshots, set up a photo booth with goofy props. For extra laughs, you could also host various holiday-themed games, such as having your attendees split into teams and have a limited amount of time to wrap one of their team members in wrapping paper. In addition to voting on the ugliest sweater, have your attendees vote on who did the best gift-wrapping job, then reveal the winners at the end for an extra layer of fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20. Frozen-inspired party\n\n\n\nChannel the popular movie Frozen with icy blues, silvers, and snowflake decor. This theme is perfect for families with little ones. Encourage kids to dress as their favorite characters, and set up a sing-along station with songs from the movie. It\u2019s not a proper party without treats! Consider offering Frozen inspired foods like snowflake decorated cupcakes with Elsa toppers or blue jello with marshmallow Olaf\u2019s! Be sure to add a question during the checkout process about food allergies to make sure your treats are safe for all.\n\n\n\n21. Snowflake ball\n\n\n\nHosting a formal event this winter? Try this snowflake ball theme! Imagine silver and white decor with glittering snowflake accents to set an elegant tone. Use a snow machine to create a magical entrance, give out snowflake-themed party favors, and play live music or hire a DJ for dancing throughout the night. Encourage guests to dress super fancy to truly make your event feel like a ball! Consider selling tickets so your attendees can secure their spot or even reserve a table at your awesome event..\n\n\n\n22. Winter luau\n\n\n\nTired of the cold weather? Give a tropical twist to your event with a winter luau! Decorate with Hawaiian shirts, leis, and tiki torches, but still keep some of the winter vibe with snowy accents or icy cocktails. Serve tropical cocktails like coconut eggnog or pineapple-infused hot toddies. Set up online ticket sales through your event platform to offer early-bird pricing or group discounts for larger parties. If you\u2019re looking for ways to engage your attendees, set up a snow-themed limbo contest, using a frosty bar as the limbo pole. You could also host a \"snowball toss\" into tropical-themed buckets or a ring toss with pineapples or tiki statues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23. Pajama party\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re never too old for a pajama party! Encourage guests to wear their favorite winter pajamas, and create a warm atmosphere by transforming your seating to look like forts! Add tons of cushions and pillows to invite guests to bundle up and relax. Breakfast-for-dinner dishes like pancakes or waffles is a fun play on this theme too. Provide fun games like charades, board games, and karaoke, or even put on your favorite Christmas movie. Hosting a small gathering? Consider hosting a white elephant gift exchange to make your guests feel like it's Christmas morning!\n\n\n\n24. New Year's Eve ice gala\n\n\n\nHost a black-tie New Year\u2019s Eve gala with shimmering ice sculptures, frosted glassware, and cool blue lighting. Want to take it a step further?

Winter beer &amp; wine tasting\n\n\n\nElevate your holiday parties with a sophisticated beer &amp; wine tasting event, showcasing seasonal craft beers and wines.

Hosting events can bring in extra income while showcasing your land\u2019s natural charm. Whether it\u2019s a cozy farm-to-table dinner, a lively harvest festival, or a rustic wedding, there are countless ways to draw in guests and create unforgettable experiences. Let\u2019s explore creative event ideas and smart strategies to help you maximize revenue for your agribusiness!\n\n\n\nWhy events work well on farms, orchards, and vineyards\n\n\n\nEvents on farms, orchards, and vineyards offer something super unique compared to traditional venues. Instead of the usual ballroom or conference room, guests get an authentic experience out in nature \u2013 whether it\u2019s a picnic in the orchard, a wine tasting among the vines, or a hands-on workshop like cheese-making or flower arranging. These types of events create a stronger, more personal connection with both locals and visitors, turning them into advocates who keep coming back for more. By leveraging the natural appeal, you\u2019re offering an experience that stands out and draws people in.\n\n\n\n8 creative event ideas to host on your farm, orchard, or vineyard\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dive into some creative event ideas that\u2019ll be sure to make money on a farm!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Harvest festivals\n\n\n\nHarvest festivals are a fantastic way to celebrate the season and draw people to your farm. Think about hosting fall-themed activities that highlight your crops \u2013 like pumpkin picking, apple cider tasting, or even grape stomping. You can invite local vendors, farmers, and craftspeople to set up booths too. Offer plenty of kid-friendly activities, like hayrides, a petting zoo, or corn mazes, to make it an event for the whole family. The key is to create an atmosphere that's festive and welcoming, so think about using simple fall decorations, like hay bales, pumpkins, or string lights, to enhance the natural beauty of your space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Farm-to-table dinners\n\n\n\nFarm-to-table dinners showcase your produce while partnering with local chefs to create memorable meals. Before dinner, offer guests a guided tour of the property \u2013 people will love to see where their food is grown! When planning the menu, highlight your farm's fresh offerings and consider pairing dishes with local wines or ciders. Promote the event as an exclusive experience, and sell tickets in advance to gauge interest and boost your bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Weddings and private events\n\n\n\nIf you have a picturesque location, consider marketing it as a venue for weddings and private events. Couples are increasingly looking for unique, rustic settings, and your farm, orchard, or vineyard could be just the spot they\u2019re dreaming of. Offer customizable packages that can include ceremony and reception spaces, catering, and even d\u00e9cor options. Don\u2019t forget to think about practical details, like parking and restroom facilities, which can make or break a guest\u2019s experience. Also, reach out to local schools or community organizations that might be interested in renting your space for their events, such as fundraisers or reunions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Workshops and classes\n\n\n\nHosting workshops and classes is a creative way to draw visitors to your farm business and share your expertise! You could offer hands-on activities like cheese-making, fruit preservation, wine tasting, or gardening workshops. Think about inviting local experts or running the workshops yourself, especially if you have a unique skill set. Keep the classes small to ensure a personalized experience, and consider offering a discount for group bookings or repeat attendees to encourage more sign-ups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Outdoor movie nights\n\n\n\nAn open field or vineyard can make a perfect setting for outdoor movie nights. All you need is a large screen, a projector, and some cozy seating options \u2013 think blankets, hay bales, or even vintage chairs. You can add a farm-to-table snack bar featuring your farm's produce, like fresh popcorn, apple cider donuts, or seasonal fruit salads. This type of event is easy to set up and can be a great way to bring in people who might not typically visit a farm or vineyard. Promote it as a family-friendly night out, and consider charging a small admission fee or selling snacks to generate extra income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Wine, cider, and produce tastings\n\n\n\nTasting events are an engaging way to showcase what your farm, orchard, or vineyard has to offer. Set up tasting stations for your wines, ciders, or fresh produce, and consider pairing sessions with local cheeses, breads, or charcuterie to enhance the experience. Make the event interactive by sharing the story behind each product, and offer guests the chance to purchase their favorites onsite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. U-pick events\n\n\n\nU-pick events can be a fun pop-up event to bring people to your property during peak harvest seasons. Let visitors pick their own fruits, vegetables, or grapes, and consider adding educational elements like farm tours or demonstrations on sustainable organic farming practices. This not only provides a great family outing but also helps people connect with where their food comes from. To make it easy, provide baskets or bags for picking, and consider offering a small discount for those who pick above a certain amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Farm stays, glamping, and vineyard retreats\n\n\n\nIf you have the space, consider offering overnight farm stays, glamping, or vineyard retreats. People love unique opportunities to get away, and a rural setting offers a chance to unwind and connect with nature. Include activities like farm tours, animal feeding, or wine tasting under the stars to create a memorable experience. Mark off a dedicated area for people to purchase space to pitch their tents or to park their RV. It\u2019s important that you have at least one or more locations with restrooms and showers too (you can rent a portable version if you don\u2019t have a building). You could also set up a few cozy tents yourself or, if you have the additional budget, invest in refurbishing an old barn into guest rooms. Partner with local businesses to offer additional services like yoga classes or guided nature walks to enhance the stay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 extra ways to maximize revenue beyond ticket sales\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered how online event ticket sales offer a fantastic opportunity to boost your income, but let's explore a few other ways to maximize the agritourism in your area!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Merchandise\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to selling merchandise, consider offering branded products that capture the spirit of your farm \u2013 items like honey, jams, or wine. Event-specific merchandise, such as mugs, T-shirts, or tote bags, can also be a hit with guests who want a memento. To maximize visibility, place a small merch stand near the entrance or main event area, where attendees are likely to browse and buy.\n\n\n\n2. Food and drink\n\n\n\nSet up food stands or carts with delicious offerings made from your farm-grown ingredients or orchard fruits (e.g., fresh apple cider, grilled veggies, or homemade jams). Why not add a \u201cfarm-to-glass\u201d bar featuring farm products like your wines, ciders, or local craft beverages? The key is to offer items they can\u2019t get anywhere else, like a signature cocktail that showcases your farm\u2019s produce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Photography packages\n\n\n\nHire a professional photographer to capture candid moments and sell photo packages to attendees, giving them a treasured memory to take home. Or, instead of hiring a photographer, charge a \"photography fee\" that lets guests bring their own photographer to use your scenic spots. Establish a few picturesque areas around your property, such as a rustic barn or vineyard row, to encourage photo-taking.\n\n\n\n4. Vendor partnerships\n\n\n\nTeaming up with local markets or vendors can create a win-win situation. By inviting local artisans and businesses to sell their products at your event, you not only add variety for your guests but also create an opportunity for additional revenue through vendor fees or profit-sharing. Select food trucks, caterers, or specialty vendors that align perfectly with your event's mission and target market. Plus, cross-promotions with these partners can help attract a broader audience to your farm.\n\n\n\n5. Raffles and auctions\n\n\n\nRaffles and auctions are an extra fun way to engage your audience and raise extra funds! To spark interest, offer farm-related prizes (like baskets of fresh produce, private tours, or exclusive wine tastings) to the winners of your giveaway. Consider partnering with your sponsors or other local businesses for additional prizes as well. Set up a table where attendees can purchase tickets or place bids throughout the event, then announce the winners near the end to end your event on a super high note!\n\n\n\n6. Bonfire rentals\n\n\n\nWhen the weather cools down, bonfire rentals can add a cozy, memorable touch to your events. Set up designated bonfire spots, and rent them out to groups looking to enjoy a relaxing evening under the stars. Enhance the experience by offering s'mores kits, blankets, or hot drinks as add-ons. Make sure the setup includes comfortable seating, ambient lighting, and clear safety measures to ensure everyone feels comfortable and safe. Promoting these bonfire rentals as a unique, intimate way to conclude the day can make your venue a standout choice for visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing your farm, orchard, or vineyard events\n\n\n\nLooking to spread the word about your event? Try out these tactics to market your farm event!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeverage social media\n\n\n\nSocial media is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal for marketing events on your farm, orchard, or vineyard. Share behind-the-scenes content and teasers leading up to the event. For example, think about posting photos or videos of your preparations, like setting up decorations or harvesting produce. This builds anticipation and gives your audience a sneak peek of what to expect. Use hashtags and geo-tags to help your posts reach a wider audience and get your event trending locally. Consider running seasonal giveaways or offering exclusive discounts and limited-time merchandise around holidays to create additional buzz.\n\n\n\nPartner with local businesses\n\n\n\nCollaborating with local businesses can boost your bottom line and attract more attendees at the same time! Work on cross-promotions like offering discount codes for customers of both businesses or running joint advertising campaigns. Make sure to feature these local vendors and sponsors prominently in your marketing materials. After all, a little extra visibility goes a long way in building strong partnerships! For example, a local bakery could offer a free treat to anyone who shows proof of ticket purchase, and in return, you could promote their business at your event.\n\n\n\nEmail marketing\n\n\n\nBuilding an email list can be one of your most effective marketing strategies. Start collecting emails from past attendees, local supporters, and anyone who expresses interest in your events. Use this list to send out invitations, early bird offers, and reminders as the event date approaches. Make your emails feel personal by sharing stories, highlighting unique aspects of the event, or including exclusive discounts for subscribers. Remember, people are more likely to attend if they feel like they\u2019re getting something special just for them!\n\n\n\nLeverage online ticketing tools\n\n\n\nMake it as easy as possible for people to buy tickets by leveraging an online ticketing platform with features perfect for farms! Build a perfectly branded ticketing page with all your event details,&nbsp; and include the link to it on all of your marketing materials. With an event ticketing platform like TicketLeap, our user-friendly interface also automatically generates a QR code for you to add to your flyers! Consider offering group discounts or bundled packages to encourage larger purchases \u2013 for instance, a \u201cfamily pack\u201d or a \u201cfriends' night out\u201d bundle. Mention these deals prominently in your promotions to incentivize people to act quickly and buy more tickets at once. The easier your purchase process is and the more enticing your incentives are, the better your ticket sales will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart planning your next farm event today!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe hope we\u2019ve got your mind full of event ideas to try for your farm! From planning to marketing, you're all set on how to make money on a small farm. The next step? Putting your tickets on sale! Simplify ticketing with TicketLeap's powerful event ticketing software.

The other half? Making sure your haunt earns you more than enough money to do this year after year! That's where setting up multiple revenue streams comes in. Not only can additional income sources boost your profits, but they can also enhance the overall experience for your thrill-seeking visitors. Let's explore some ghoulishly good ways to increase revenue for haunts!\n\n\n\n1. Merchandise sales\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love a good souvenir? Merchandise sales are a fantastic way to let your visitors take a piece of the horror home with them.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Consider offering themed T-shirts and hoodies that capture the spirit of your haunted attraction. Hats and beanies with your haunt logo can be popular items, especially during cooler evenings in the fall. Don't forget about smaller souvenirs like keychains, mugs, and posters that can appeal to a wide range of budgets.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: To make the most of merchandise sales, focus on designing unique, spooky items that align closely with your haunt's theme. Once you\u2019ve got your merchandise designed and ready to sell, set up your merchandise booth in a high-traffic area, such as near the exit, to catch visitors as they leave your terrifying experience with adrenaline still pumping. Consider offering bundled tickets that include merchandise, and add a merch store to your website to keep the sales coming after your event too!Potential challenge + solution: Upfront costs for inventory can be steep, so start small with a few popular items and use pre-orders to gauge interest before making larger investments on merch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Themed concessions\n\n\n\nNothing works up an appetite like being scared out of your wits! Offering themed food and drinks can add to your guests\u2019 experience while putting more money in your pocket.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Get creative with spooky-themed food items like \"Witches' Brew\" drinks and \"Monster Burgers\". Halloween-themed snacks such as candied apples and popcorn are always popular too! For an extra touch, create uniquely branded food items that fit your haunt's unique theme.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Consider partnering with local food vendors or setting up your own food booths to offer these treats. Create themed menu items that are not only visually appealing but also tasty. To boost sales, offer package deals that include a meal and a ticket discount, encouraging visitors to dine at your haunt.Potential challenge + solution: Managing food safety and health regulations can be complicated, but they\u2019re super important! Make sure to research what training is needed in your state to properly handle food yourself, or partner with established food vendors who already have the necessary permits and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. VIP experiences\n\n\n\nFor those visitors who want an extra-special fright night, VIP experiences can be a profitable addition to your haunt!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Fast passes for skipping lines can be a hot commodity on busy nights, especially the closer you get to Halloween! For an even more exclusive experience, consider offering private scare zones that give thrill-seekers their own personal nightmare.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Develop tiered ticketing options with added perks to cater to different levels of VIP experiences. For example, you could offer a silver tier that includes a fast pass to skip lines, a gold tier that adds access to exclusive merch, and a platinum tier that includes all of the above plus a private tour of the haunt with a meet-and-greet with the actors. Pro tip: limiting the availability of these experiences helps create a sense of urgency and exclusivity for those who buy them.Potential challenge + solution: Regular guests might feel left out or wish they got VIP passes once they arrive, so offer a limited number of VIP upgrades onsite each night to give everyone a chance to enjoy your more premium experiences. And be sure to highlight the value of your VIP experience so guests know what they're paying for!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Photo opportunities\n\n\n\nCapture the screams, hilarious facial expressions, and memorable moments from inside your haunt with photo ops that your visitors will want to buy and take home with them!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Set up professional photo booths with spooky backdrops that fit your haunt's theme. For an interactive twist, create photo opportunities with live actors that can truly capture the terror of the moment.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Consider hiring professional photographers or using automated photo booths for efficiency. Put effort into creating visually striking and interactive photo backdrops that will make for shareable, memorable images. For those candid moments, set up cameras throughout your haunt that are set to snap after your scare trigger! Offer both digital downloads and printed photo packages for sale to cater to different preferences.Potential challenge + solution: Popular photo spots may end up having a line up people waiting, so use a timed ticketing system for photos or create multiple photo spots to disperse the crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Experience upgrades\n\n\n\nGive your visitors the option to level up their fear factor with additional spooky experiences!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Mini escape room add-ons with themed challenges can provide an extra thrill. As another idea, try offering interactive game zones with prizes to keep visitors engaged between scares. For the ultimate adrenaline junkies, offer scare triggers and jump scare activations they can control.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: When designing escape rooms, ensure the puzzles and challenges fit your haunt's theme seamlessly. Set time limits to keep people moving through so everyone can enjoy the experience. For scare triggers, it could be a button or lever that attendees pull to activate a hidden air cannon, loud noise, or sudden movement of a nearby prop, like a monster springing out or a skeleton dropping from the ceiling. Promote these as separate or add-on experiences to your regular tickets, emphasizing how these upgrades will bring an extra level of fun to their experience.Potential challenge + solutions: Handling added experiences can require a lot more event logistics, so be sure to plan ahead and train your staff thoroughly. Create clear signage to guide visitors through the upgraded experiences smoothly and ensure maximum safety at your haunt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Special nights\n\n\n\nKeep your crowd coming back for more with themed nights and special events.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Host costume contests and themed parties like Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller or zombie apocalypse. Offer lights-on walkthroughs of your attraction for your curious but cautious guests. Consider no scare or family-friendly nights with toned-down scares to attract a wider audience. For the brave, try blackout nights with minimal lighting (glow sticks only) or touch scare nights for a more intense experience.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Schedule these events on off-peak nights (like mid-week in the fall) to boost attendance during slower periods. For more thrilling experiences on these nights, incentivize guests to participate in costume contests by offering cool prizes, like your haunts merch, for the best costumes. To promote these special events, leverage social media, local community groups, and email marketing.Potential challenge + solution: Since these themed nights may bring different crowds with different expectations from their experience, clearly advertise the nature of each special night so visitors know what to expect and can choose the experience that suits them best. This especially goes for visitors who want to ensure they\u2019re going to get too scared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Sponsorship and partnerships\n\n\n\nDon't overlook the potential of partnering with other businesses to boost your revenue!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Offer ad space on your tickets to local businesses, and set up at-event sponsor signage throughout your haunt. You could also sell banner ads on your website, spotlights on your newsletter emails, and shoutouts on your social media. For a more immersive approach, incorporate sponsors into your set design in creative ways like adding an interactive element with branded props or a specific room provided by your sponsor.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Identify potential sponsors that align well with your haunt's audience and theme, like your local escape room, ax-throwing venue, or costume store. Showcase a range of branding opportunities and exclusive promotions on your website for sponsors to choose from. Look for ways to leverage these partnerships for mutual marketing benefits, expanding your reach while providing value to your sponsors.Potential challenge + solution: Acquiring sponsorships can be difficult sometimes, so ensure that you build a compelling sponsorship package that highlights the return on investment your sponsors will receive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Workshops and behind-the-scenes tours\n\n\n\nGive curious visitors a peek behind the curtain of how you make your haunted experiences a reality!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Teach aspiring haunters the art of makeup and special effects through hands-on workshops. Take visitors behind the scenes to uncover the magic that brings your haunt to life. For those passionate about the craft, host educational sessions on haunt creation and design, offering insider knowledge and inspiration for their own haunts.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Schedule these workshops and tours during non-operating hours to avoid conflicting with the main attraction. Bring in experts or use your skilled staff to conduct engaging sessions. Promote these as educational experiences for haunt enthusiasts, emphasizing the exclusive nature of the insider knowledge being shared.Potential challenge + solution: You\u2019ll want to ensure there\u2019s enough interest to ensure you\u2019ll have great attendance to your more niche workshops, so launch a survey to gauge interest in different topics before committing to your sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Midway entertainment\n\n\n\nKeep visitors engaged before and after the main attraction, while maximizing your revenue streams as you do so.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Set up a bar with themed drinks to create the perfect mood and enhance the energy with live music performances. You may even invite fire-handling performers or other awesome entertainers! Add to the excitement with interactive midway games and attractions (e.g., bobbing for apples, pumpkin smash, creepy claw machine) that seamlessly align with your haunt's theme.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Build a lineup of local musicians and entertainment acts to bring in fresh talent each week, encouraging attendees to come back to your haunt again and again. Make sure to optimize the layout of your attraction with clear signage to naturally guide guests through your different experiences. Build the hype by using social media to promote these additional attractions.Potential challenge + solution: Finding and booking the right entertainment may require some sleuthing. Get connected with your local music scene through Facebook groups and reach out to local venues to discover how to book their acts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Off-season events\n\n\n\nWho says the scares have to stop when Halloween is over? Host haunted events throughout the year to keep the party going!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIdeas: Create haunted events around other holidays throughout the year! Once Halloween ends and people gear up for Christmas, host \u201cKrampus\u201d or \u201cMerry Frightmas\u201d events for a twisted holiday experience. Then, in February, celebrate \u201cValloween\u201d or \u201cMy Bloody Valentine\u201d for a terrifying twist on romance. You could even create \u201cSt. Patrick's Slay\u201d or \u201cSt. Paddy's Nightmare\u201d events in March. Once May rolls around, mark the \u201cHalfway to Halloween\u201d milestone with some extra fun haunts. Don\u2019t forget to capitalize on Friday the 13th with special haunt nights whenever they occur!\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Decorate with festive yet spooky elements to fit each season\u2019s unique theme. Offer specially themed experiences and packages for each event. Market these as unique attractions during the off-season, appealing to thrill-seekers looking for some fun frights year-round!Potential challenge + solution: Since it can be challenging to maintain staff for year-round events, we recommend partnering with local theater groups or hiring seasonal workers for these special events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for frightful financial gains&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere you have it! You\u2019ve got ten new ways on how to make money beyond ticket sales for a haunted attraction! Why not give it a shot? Your haunt's bottom line will thank you, and your visitors will love the enhanced experience.

Most of the time, this is the main way you\u2019ll make money from events. With a ticketing platform like TicketLeap, you can take full advantage of ticketing tiers like VIP, general admission, and timed entry to help maximize your profit. Boost interest from the get-go with early bird specials, and attract more attendees with discounts for group purchases or different ages (e.g., college students, seniors, etc.).\n\n\n\nYou could also sell season passes, weekend passes, and tickets to recurring events, which not only generate more ticket sales but boost loyalty. Plus, cross-sell tickets to other events you're hosting to keep your attendees coming back for more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Premium experiences &amp; add-ons\n\n\n\nGive your attendees their dream VIP experience! Selling premium experiences and add-ons will unlock a significant revenue stream to maximize your event tickets! Try offering exclusive premium tickets to meet and greets, pre- or post-shows, after parties, or exclusive Q&amp;A panels. Elevate your attendees' experience with upgraded seating options closer to the stage or in luxury areas. Take it a step further with upsells to their tickets for premium parking, food and drink packages, or exclusive merchandise.\n\n\n\n3. Sponsorships\n\n\n\nEvent sponsors are essential for boosting your revenue! Attracting sponsors begins with creating compelling, high-value sponsorship packages that showcase the benefits of partnering with your event. You could sell ad space on your website or social media, sponsored sessions, and other prime opportunities for brand visibility to make these packages irresistible. Whether it's naming rights for stages, branded photo booths, or exclusive lounges with phone charging stations and private restrooms, you can provide valuable exposure to your sponsors and share their brands with your attendees in memorable ways!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Vendors\n\n\n\nCreating opportunities for vendors, especially small businesses and artists, can help open doors for them and bring in additional profit for you! Adding a vendor alley can connect your attendees with organizations and creators that align with their interests. Whether it's artists, collectibles dealers, or local food trucks, vendors will eagerly purchase booth space at a high-traffic event filled with engaged potential customers. Another option is to work out a deal with your vendors to earn a percentage of their profits in exchange for setting up at your event. Ensure they're a perfect fit by requiring vendors to submit an application through your registration software before securing their spot. It's a win-win: increased revenue for you and exciting discoveries for your attendees!\n\n\n\n5. Merchandise\n\n\n\nBoost your sales by turning your attendees into brand ambassadors with exclusive event-branded merchandise like t-shirts, lanyards, and hats! Offer these items to help attendees remember your event while spreading your brand name to their friends and family. Boost your pre-show revenue by adding merchandise upsells to your online ticket checkout, providing convenience for your customers when they\u2019re most engaged. For VIPs, consider offering exclusive merch to further enrich their experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Concessions\n\n\n\nWhether you're hosting a music festival, sports game, or community fair, offering a variety of concessions can significantly boost your earnings. Fan-favorites like hot dogs, popcorn, and soft drinks for sporting events or artisanal snacks and craft beverages at a local fair can elevate your event and open up a new revenue channel. Make sure to have proper signage to attract attendees' attention and encourage your staff to invite guests to check out what's on sale. Set up your concession stands in high-traffic areas for the best chance at driving sales. With the right setup, this could become a popular stop for attendees that'll generate additional revenue for your event!\n\n\n\n7. Donations\n\n\n\nCollecting donations is an easy way to generate extra revenue for your events, especially for nonprofits and fundraisers! You can easily request donations through your ticketing page on platforms like TicketLeap, providing a seamless experience for attendees who wish to contribute. For hosting charity events specifically, try hosting a silent auction where guests can bid on intriguing items and super fun experiences. With these strategies, you can maximize your event's impact while supporting a great cause!\n\n\n\n8. Virtual events &amp; live streams\n\n\n\nCreate a virtual component to your events to expand your reach and boost ticket sales! Sell tickets to an exclusive livestream of your event, allowing those who can't attend in person to still participate and enjoy the experience. Ensure you have the right equipment (e.g., camera, microphone, tripod) and a streaming platform that can grant restricted access to facilitate a seamless virtual ticketed experience. Additionally, consider hosting completely virtual events, such as webinars or online classes, to create new revenue streams and connect with your audience in innovative ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Advertising\n\n\n\nCapitalize on advertising space at your event! Offer display ad placements in your email newsletters, paid posts on Facebook and Instagram, space in banners or programs, and even display ads on your event website. Having an engaged audience of event attendees presents a fantastic opportunity for advertisers to gain positive brand awareness and secure new customers, making your event an irresistible partner for brands!\n\n\n\n10. Post-event monetization\n\n\n\nMaximize your event's offering to drive additional revenue long after the event ends! Offer exclusive discounts on tickets to your next event, encouraging attendees to secure their spot early. Sell recordings of key performances, sessions, or workshops to those who want to relive the experience again or revisit valuable content. Additionally, package and sell resources such as presentation slides, e-books, or merchandise from your event. You can even create a membership program granting access to ongoing content and special offers. Not only will you boost your revenue but you'll keep your audience engaged and excited for future events!\n\n\n\nTips to maximize your event revenue\n\n\n\nWith a few strategic moves like these in your toolbox, you can confidently put on a successful and profitable event!\n\n\n\nDefine your target audience\n\n\n\nBy researching the types of people who will enjoy your event the most, you can efficiently target the specific demographics of those most likely to buy tickets. Consider key factors such as location (focus on those near your venue!), interests, and typical age range to ensure you're reaching the right crowd. This targeted approach helps you maximize the time and resources spent on your event marketing, allowing you to connect with attendees who are genuinely interested in your event. By understanding and engaging with your ideal audience, you set the stage for a successful, well-attended event that drives significant revenue!\n\n\n\nLeverage all your marketing channels\n\n\n\nBuild out a comprehensive strategy that taps into all your available marketing channels, mapping out a timeline to build momentum leading up to your event. Begin by building dynamic email campaigns with engaging subject lines and enticing promotions. Utilize in-person tactics such as flyers and word-of-mouth to generate local buzz. Be sure to ask your sponsors to help spread the word too!\n\n\n\nDive into both organic and paid social media on platforms like Facebook and TikTok, consistently update and promote your event on your website, and list it on local event directories to improve search result visibility. Collaborate with influencers to extend your reach, and write compelling press releases for media publicity. Don\u2019t forget to utilize TicketLeap's built-in marketing features, like our email campaign tool, to streamline your marketing efforts!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart marketing your events EARLY\n\n\n\nOnce you've got the essential details of your event squared away (like booking your venue), you'll want to launch your ticket sales and begin to market your event as soon as possible! Ideally, kick off your marketing efforts 4-6 months before the event to have enough time to spread the word and build anticipation. Early promotion allows you to reach your audience multiple times, ensuring they\u2019re aware and eager to attend. Once you've started, keep the momentum going by regularly updating your audience with engaging content \u2014 share sneak peeks of what to expect, behind-the-scenes looks, and countdown posts. Utilize email newsletters, social media campaigns, personalized email invitations, and even early bird ticket discounts to drive continuous interest and engagement.\n\n\n\nWatch your budget\n\n\n\nHosting events for profit isn't just about earning as much money as possible; it\u2019s equally important to keep an eye on expenses to protect your profit margin. Building and sticking to a detailed event budget helps you make smart financial decisions. Be mindful of the costs related to your venue, concessions, merchandise, or VIP experiences related to your realistic sales expectations to ensure your turn a profit. Set your ticket prices at a sweet spot \u2014 affordable enough to attract attendees but high enough to cover costs and generate profit according to your estimated attendance numbers.\n\n\n\nAnother quick tip: if an attendee requests a refund and you're hosting more than one event, encourage them to exchange their tickets for a different date instead in order to help you keep your revenue. With an awesome support team like at TicketLeap, you'll also have assistance winning any chargebacks that may happen to keep that money in your pocket too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a compelling ticketing page\n\n\n\nCreating an exciting ticketing page is a surefire way to maximize your event revenue! Using a platform like TicketLeap, you can design event ticketing pages that drive more ticket sales! Start with a captivating event description that engages potential attendees and highlights what makes your event special. Pair this with visuals that match your branding and stunning images or videos that highlight your upcoming event to draw in your audience. Don\u2019t forget to optimize for SEO by incorporating relevant keywords about your event and its location, making it easier for people to find your event online. Embed this ticketing page on your website and utilize the convenient \"Buy Tickets\" button generated by TicketLeap to streamline the purchasing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost awesome experiences!\n\n\n\nWhen your experiences are top-notch, attendees will be buzzing about them long after the event ends! On top of giving your attendees priceless memories, you'll give them opportunities to take epic photos or videos while enjoying your event. Harness the power of user-generated content by encouraging them to post that content on their social media and tag your event. Share their posts on your own page to foster a sense of community and engagement. When people have a fantastic time, they\u2019re more likely to return, and as demand grows, you can leverage higher ticket prices to drive even more revenue.\n\n\n\nNow, you're ready to host a successful and profitable event!\n\n\n\nWith meticulous planning, smart budgeting, and strategic marketing, you can confidently start generating significant revenue from events. TicketLeap offers a full suite of features and rockstar support to optimize every aspect of planning and execution for all kinds of events, whether for small gatherings or large-scale attractions.

We'll walk you through everything from brainstorming and designing your haunt to navigating safety protocols and building hype in your community. Get ready to make your own haunted house a scream-worthy success!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Prepping for your haunted house\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the details of your haunted house, there are a couple areas to consider. Let\u2019s take a look:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnderstanding your haunt-goers\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to creating a haunted house, knowing your audience is key. Start by identifying your target demographic \u2014 are you aiming to scare families with younger children, thrill-seeking teens, or adults looking for a serious fright? Doing a bit of competitor analysis can really help here. Check out what other haunted houses in your area are doing and see what works and what doesn\u2019t. Tailor your scares and themes to match your audience's preferences. For instance, families might appreciate a slightly tamer haunt, while teens and adults might crave intense, heart-pounding scares. By understanding who you're trying to attract, you can design an experience that keeps them coming back for more.\n\n\n\nSetting a budget\n\n\n\nSetting a budget is one of the first and most crucial steps in planning a haunted house. First, determine your initial costs, which will likely include permits, supplies, marketing, staff, and any actors you may hire to give good scares. It\u2019s essential to allocate your funds wisely so you know where to save and where to splurge. For example, investing in high-quality props and costumes can make a big difference, while creating some decorations yourself can help save money. Remember, you\u2019ll need to keep some funds in reserve for unexpected expenses too. By carefully planning your budget, you can ensure you\u2019re making the most of your resources while still delivering a top-notch haunted experience.\n\n\n\nLocation scouting\n\n\n\nFinding the right location for your haunted house can be a game-changer. Look for affordable venues such as barns, community centers, or even your own property if it\u2019s large enough. Consider the distance, pricing, and accessibility to attendees. You want a place that\u2019s easy for people to find and get to. One smart strategy is partnering with venues to split profits or negotiate a percentage of the ticket sales. This can significantly reduce your upfront costs. And don\u2019t forget to ensure that your location is safe and accessible for all guests. A well-chosen venue can set the stage for a hauntingly good time while staying within your budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Designing the haunted experience\n\n\n\nOnce you've got the event planning down, it's time for the super fun part \u2014 designing the haunted experience itself. Let\u2019s talk about creating a spooky layout, setting up eerie decor, and adding those hair-raising special effects that will leave your guests trembling!\n\n\n\nLayout and flow\n\n\n\nPlan the path and key scare zones carefully to ensure a thrilling experience for your guests. Think about how visitors will move through the space and where the best places are to surprise them. Avoid bottlenecks by ensuring there\u2019s enough room for people to move smoothly from one area to the next. Don\u2019t forget to include emergency exits throughout the paths so guests can leave quickly if needed.\n\n\n\nSet design and decor\n\n\n\nCreating an immersive, eerie atmosphere doesn\u2019t have to break the bank! Craft set pieces and props yourself by repurposing household items or finding treasures at thrift stores. With a bit of creativity, you can turn everyday objects into terrifying props. Lighting and sound are crucial in setting the mood \u2014 think dim lights, flickering bulbs, and eerie sounds. Think about how each room contributes to the overall theme and how you can make guests feel like they\u2019ve stepped into another world.\n\n\n\nEerie special effects\n\n\n\nBudget-friendly options like fog machines, strobe lights, and soundscapes can create an intense atmosphere. Utilize technology to your advantage \u2014 there are plenty of apps available for spooky sound effects, and you can even try your hand at animatronics for a personalized touch. Check out YouTube or online forums like Reddit to find tutorials or helpful advice on do-it-yourself special effect options.\n\n\n\nPro tip: Work at or volunteer at a local attraction in the haunted house industry to help you to gain invaluable insights towards starting your own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Crafting the scares\n\n\n\nNow that your haunted house is coming together, it's time to focus on the heart of the experience: the scares!\n\n\n\nScary-good actor training\n\n\n\nStart by recruiting volunteers, like members of a drama department at a local high school or college. These aspiring actors are often the best candidates with the enthusiasm and skills needed for the job. You can also post job listings on sites like ZipRecruiter or Indeed. Once you have your team, it's essential to train them to deliver consistent and safe scares. Conduct rehearsals to refine their timing and reactions, ensuring they know how to best scare your guests. Remind them to stay in character and maintain energy throughout the event \u2014 consistent performances are key to a truly terrifying experience. Depending on the intensity of your haunt, you\u2019ll need to go over what they\u2019re allowed and prohibited to do with your haunt-goers, so they have a safe yet exhilarating experience.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPetrifying props and costumes\n\n\n\nStart your costume and prop search with affordable items from thrift stores, garage sales, and online marketplaces. For a personal touch, try creating realistic and terrifying effects yourself. For example, use old clothes and paint to create fake blood-stained garments or repurpose household items into eerie props. The more detailed and realistic your props and costumes are, the more convincing your haunted house will be, adding to your overall fright factor!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Enforcing safety guidelines and regulations\n\n\n\nSafety first! Let's break down what you need to do to protect your guests and comply with all necessary regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety protocols\n\n\n\nEnsuring the safety of your guests and staff is paramount. To adequately plan for emergencies, make sure your haunted house has clearly marked exits, a first aid station, and adequate security personnel. Prepare for unexpected weather by having contingency plans, such as covered waiting areas, alternate routes, or a communication strategy for any event cancellation. It's also important to train your actors on your haunt\u2019s rules based on its intensity to suit different comfort levels. This can include how close they are allowed to get to your attendees, if they\u2019re able to touch them in any capacity, and vice versa. By prioritizing safety, you create a secure environment where everyone can enjoy the scares without unnecessary risks.\n\n\n\nLegal considerations\n\n\n\nNavigating the legal aspects on how to make a haunted house is essential yet can seem daunting, but we\u2019re here to help! First, acquire the necessary permits and insurance to protect yourself and your guests. Make sure to include warnings about certain effects, like strobe lights, which can trigger health issues for some attendees. For understanding local regulations and compliance \u2014 check out resources like the Life Safety 101 Code Book, which has a section on special amusement attractions. Additionally, be sure to draft a waiver for attendees to sign that acknowledges the potential risks involved with going through your haunt. This not only covers your legal bases but also informs guests about what to expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Launching your ticket sales\n\n\n\nReady to start selling your haunt\u2019s tickets? Let's explore how to effectively build your event page, price your tickets, and utilize event ticketing software features to streamline the process!\n\n\n\nCrafting a spooky event page\n\n\n\nYour event page is the first impression potential guests will have of your haunted house, so make it count! Craft a spooky, engaging event description that sets the tone and entices visitors. Use eerie imagery, haunting language, and highlight the unique aspects of your haunted house. The goal is to create excitement and anticipation, making people eager to purchase online tickets to experience the scares firsthand.\n\n\n\nSetting tantalizing ticket prices&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPricing your tickets appropriately is key to bringing in more guests while ensuring you make a profit. Research similar events in your area to get a sense of the going rates. Consider offering early bird discounts to encourage advanced sales and build buzz. This not only helps you generate ticket sales right out of the gate, but it also creates a sense of urgency for people to buy now. Additionally, think about different pricing tiers based on the intensity level or time of entry, giving guests options that fit their budget while maximizing your revenue.\n\n\n\nAdding your event waiver\n\n\n\nProtect yourself legally and inform guests of any potential risks by adding your event waiver to your online ticket purchase process. With a platform like TicketLeap, you can easily add this waiver to your ticket checkout. Your waiver should clearly explain any health and safety warnings, such as strobe lights or physical contact from actors. By requiring attendees to acknowledge and accept these terms, you can minimize liability and ensure everyone is aware of what to expect. This transparency helps build trust and ensures a smoother experience for all involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Marketing and promoting your haunt\n\n\n\nNow that your haunted house is taking shape, it\u2019s time to spread the word and fill those eerie halls with thrill-seeking guests!\n\n\n\nBuilding hype for your scare\n\n\n\nStart marketing your haunted house early \u2013 about 3-4 months before your event \u2013 by leveraging social media. Create engaging content such as spooky skits, teaser videos of your haunted house setup, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your actors preparing to scare their victims (like a time lapse of getting into costume!). You could also host a costume contest or post a giveaway for tickets to generate buzz and get more people excited for your haunt. To go the extra mile, collaborate with local influencers and media outlets, like your local TV stations or newspaper, to spread the word. Invite the influencers you partner with to visit your haunt and share their experiences with their followers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEngaging your community\n\n\n\nEngaging with your local community can amplify your haunted house's visibility and support. Partner with nearby businesses for sponsorships to give you additional funds or donations in exchange for exposure at your event. With your sponsors, organize promotions like joint marketing campaigns or exclusive discounts for their customers who attend your haunt. This not only enhances your reach but also gives businesses in your community a fun way to reward their loyal customers around Halloween. Consider hosting community events or workshops related to your haunted house theme like a Halloween fundraiser or a pumpkin carving session to further integrate your event into local culture. By actively involving your community, you create a shared sense of excitement and ownership over the spooky spectacle you\u2019re creating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Conducting a post-event review\n\n\n\nAs the last screams echo through your haunted house, let\u2019s turn our attention to what comes next: gathering valuable feedback and assessing the success of your spine-chilling event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCollecting feedback from your haunt-goers\n\n\n\nUse a combination of surveys and social media to gather insights into their experiences. Surveys can be sent out via email or handed out at the exit, asking about their favorite scares, any areas they felt could be improved, and their overall level of satisfaction. Social media platforms are great for collecting more immediate feedback, encouraging guests to share their thoughts and photos from the event. Once you\u2019ve gathered feedback, analyze it carefully to identify trends and areas for improvement. Pay attention to recurring comments or suggestions, as these often highlight the most impactful changes you can make for future events.\n\n\n\nEvaluating your haunted house\u2019s success\n\n\n\nMeasuring the success of your haunted house goes beyond just counting ticket sales. Start by calculating your profit and expenses to determine your financial performance. This helps you understand whether your event was financially viable and where you might need to adjust costs for next time. Beyond finances, assess what worked well and what could be improved based on guest feedback and your own observations. Consider factors like attendance numbers, guest satisfaction levels, and any media coverage or community buzz you generated. Take note of successful promotional tactics to take advantage of again next year and areas where you may want to refine your operations or enhance the guest experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour haunted house journey begins here!\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200bCongratulations on embarking on the journey on how to start a haunted house! By now, you've learned the ins and outs of planning, designing, and executing a spooky and unforgettable event. From crafting spine-chilling scares to navigating safety protocols and legal considerations, every detail plays a crucial role in delivering a thrilling experience.

Whether it's bad weather, an illness, or some other unforeseen circumstance, canceling an event is one of the toughest calls you might have to make as an event organizer. But don't worry \u2014 we're here to help ensure you're prepared for anything! After all, it's always wise to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. With a few smart strategies in place, you'll be ready to handle any event cancellation that may come your way.\n\n\n\nWhen should event organizers cancel an event?\n\n\n\nYour attendees\u2019 safety and providing them the best experience possible is the number one priority! While canceling your event should be the last resort, here are some factors that'll help you discern if it's the right decision.\n\n\n\n1. Inclement weather\n\n\n\nThunderstorms, tornadoes, snow, or even extreme heat can force you to make the tough call to cancel. This is especially true for outdoor events, which are most vulnerable to these unpredictable elements. If you're hosting an event outside and you\u2019re expecting tough weather, booking a venue indoors as a tentative backup option can ensure you don't have to cancel. If the road conditions look too dangerous (especially in more snowy climates), canceling your event helps keep your attendees safe and off of dangerous roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Low attendance\n\n\n\nOnce you've set your event budget, you'll have a clear idea of the attendance numbers needed to breakeven and turn a profit. If ticket sales fall short of your target, it might not balance out your event costs. When faced with low attendance, canceling the event can sometimes be the most responsible decision. To try and avoid this, having a strategic plan to boost your event marketing or to gain more sponsors could help bring more people in the door and boost your bottom line.\n\n\n\n3. Unforeseen circumstances\n\n\n\nUnforeseen circumstances can pop up at any time, and being prepared to handle them is key for any event organizer. Health concerns, such as a key speaker or performer getting sick, may force you to cancel if finding a replacement isn't feasible. Complications with your staff or issues with the venue \u2014 like unexpected maintenance problems or double-booking \u2014 can also lead to last-minute cancellations. So, remember, flexibility and contingency planning are essential! When these unpredictable challenges arise, making the tough decision to cancel can sometimes be the best way to protect your event\u2019s integrity and ensure future success.\n\n\n\nIs it better to cancel or reschedule?\n\n\n\nIdeally, having a well-thought-out plan B will help you avoid canceling or rescheduling altogether! If the issue is temporary like bad weather,, postponing to a later date might be the best option. Rescheduling allows you to maintain your event's momentum and gives your attendees something to look forward to without entirely losing the time and effort you've already invested. However, if the issues at hand are more long-term or unpredictable, a full cancellation might be more practical. Canceling may make more sense for seasonal events especially, such as a Christmas parade, a Halloween celebration, or a New Year's Eve party, where specific dates are crucial for success.\n\n\n\nBefore making the call to cancel or postpone, weigh all the factors carefully. Is the problem something that could be resolved by moving the event to a later date? Or is cancellation truly unavoidable? This is a big decision, so you want to be as sure as possible that this is the best route to take for your attendees and stakeholders.\n\n\n\nDeliberating with your team\n\n\n\nStill on the fence whether to cancel your event or not? Call your team together and get their feedback! It's a big decision that should have input from your key players, such as leading team members, guest speakers and their management, and your sponsors. While it's understandable that meeting with everyone may not always be feasible with their availability (especially if a fast response is necessary), a virtual meeting or call with those available can often suffice.\n\n\n\nDuring these discussions, you'll want to first see if any workarounds are possible to save you from canceling or postponing your in-person event. Once you've agreed it\u2019s best to cancel your event, it's time to discuss next steps. This includes determining what messaging to use when presenting this cancellation publicly and who'll be in charge of refunding ticket holders. For any staff who couldn't attend, make sure to contact them afterwards so they're on the same page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to cancel an event the right way\n\n\n\nWant to handle canceling an event as gracefully as possible? It's best to have a plan beforehand (with these tips below to help!) to give you more control over the situation.\n\n\n\n1. Stop selling tickets\n\n\n\nAs soon as you decide to cancel an event, shutting off ticket sales should be your top priority! Thankfully, this can be easily done with the click of a button. Acting quickly is crucial to prevent any further sales that'll need to be refunded. It's a good idea to include a clear cancellation policy on your ticketing page or website beforehand so attendees know exactly what to expect. This proactive approach will keep your audience informed and build trust with them.\n\n\n\n2. Email your attendees ASAP\n\n\n\nTo notify your attendees about the cancellation, send out an email blast as soon as possible! As part of TicketLeap's suite of features, you can send this blast to all your ticket buyers straight from your ticketing platform. Feel free to use one of our handy email templates at the bottom of this article to get you started. First, write an email subject line that clearly states your event name and that it has been canceled. Establishing a sense of urgency with a phrase like \"Breaking News\", \"Urgent\", or \"Important Update\" can hopefully help people click into your email as well.\n\n\n\nWithin your email's message, clearly explain why you had to cancel your event. If you're hosting multiple events, specify which date(s) and time(s) are affected. Knowing people have been excited and set aside time to come, show sympathy towards those disappointed by this news. Emphasize that their well-being is your top priority, particularly if the cancellation is due to health, safety, or weather concerns. Next, you must include details on refunds and rescheduling. Lastly, keep an eye on your inbox to promptly address any concerns from attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Post your event cancellation to other channels\n\n\n\nYou'll need to send out more than an email to alert everyone! This is especially important to do too in case they missed the email in their inbox, or it ended up in their spam folder. Here are a few other channels to share your canceled event message with your attendees.\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\n\nMost attendees are easily reached on their phones, so posting your announcement on social media will make it more likely that they'll see it in time. Then, they can also easily share the cancellation with any of their family and friends who had tickets too. Feel free to use the same message as your event cancellation email, but make sure it's within the word count of your selected social media platform.\n\n\n\nAs another idea, we recommend posting an apology video (on TikTok especially!) from the event organizer or special guests of your event to add a personal touch and demonstrate how much you care about your attendees. Another important thing: keep an eye on the comments. You'll want to make sure to clarify any additional questions people have, show compassion to anyone frustrated with the cancellation, and thank people for their understanding.\n\n\n\nYour website\n\n\n\nWhen canceling an event, it's essential to post a clear message on your event's website right away. Let your audience know about the cancellation and advise them to keep an eye out for an email from you with all the important details. Since inboxes can be flooded with emails and people's social media feeds fill with other posts, having this announcement on your website ensures it stays in an easy to find place for people to refer to.\n\n\n\nPress releases\n\n\n\nIssuing a press release is an effective way to announce the cancellation of larger events like a city block party, seasonal festival, or art fair. You'll want to write up an article to share with news outlets that covers all the main points regarding your canceled event. This includes your reasons for canceling, refund details, your plans to reschedule or not, and a heartfelt apology. This ensures that your local community is aware and builds deeper trust with them.\n\n\n\n4. Handle refunds with a personal touch\n\n\n\nWithin your event cancellation email, make sure you clearly inform your ticket buyers whether you'll automatically refund them or if you'll transfer their ticket to the newly scheduled date. Provide them with instructions on how to contact you with their request (whether through your support email or a phone number) and a deadline to contact you by. As for administering the full refunds, the process is super simple with TicketLeap! You can automatically pass those funds back to your attendees' accounts with just a click of a button.\n\n\n\nWhen you contact your attendees and as they reach out to you for support, be sure to thank everyone for their patience and offer to answer any additional questions they may have regarding their refund. If you need extra help managing refunds, TicketLeap allows you to use user roles to delegate team members the ability to issue refunds as well. Additionally, with TicketLeap\u2019s ticket exchange feature, attendees have the option to move their ticket to another event on your roster. This level of support will demonstrate your commitment to a positive customer experience, even in the face of unexpected changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Reflect and look ahead\n\n\n\nOnce everything has settled, take this opportunity to assess how your team managed the situation and identify where you can improve. Could communication have been even clearer? Was the refund process as smooth as it could be? If you're planning to reschedule, now's the time to reach out to vendors and confirm their availability for your new date. Make sure your venue can accommodate the change, ideally having a backup date already planned to avoid scheduling conflicts.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, send a follow-up email to your attendees with all the new details, including where they can find their updated tickets. Consider sending out a survey to your ticket holders to gather their feedback and make them feel heard regarding the cancellation too. Confirm that your guest speakers or performers are available for the new dates, and if not, start looking for suitable replacements. If low attendance was the reason for cancellation, reevaluate your marketing strategy and consider pivoting to different opportunities if necessary. By taking these proactive steps, you'll be better prepared for future events and deliver the best experiences possible!\n\n\n\nHow can I plan ahead for any future event cancellations?\n\n\n\nPlanning ahead is a smart move that can save you potential event cancellations down the road! Start by building a clear plan on how you'd handle such a situation, so you're ready to act fast if it happens. Decide in advance whether you'll offer refunds or allow attendees to hold onto their tickets for a rescheduled date. Communication is key, so determine what channels you'll use to announce (e.g., email, social media, website).\n\n\n\nYou'll also want to discuss your plan with the venue you've booked, any vendors, your sponsors, any guest performers, and more so they'll know exactly what would happen should your next event get canceled. As you make payments of your event's various expenses, you'll also want to determine which are refundable or not, or if you can receive a partial refund after a certain date. By having a well-thought-out strategy, you'll be able to manage cancellations smoothly and maintain trust with your attendees!\n\n\n\nConsider getting event cancellation insurance\n\n\n\nGetting event cancellation insurance can offer additional protection against unforeseen circumstances. Start by talking to your insurance provider about event cancellation coverage, which can help cover any financial losses from nonrefundable payments made leading up to your event. Some providers might only offer this type of event insurance for private gatherings like weddings, while others may be willing to insure larger public, business, or sporting events. The size of your guest list can also play a role in determining if your event is insurable.\n\n\n\nIt's essential to explore these options well in advance, as you can secure event cancellation coverage up to two years before your planned date. This ensures you're prepared for any unexpected changes and can confidently move forward knowing your investment into this event is protected. By obtaining the right coverage, you'll not only safeguard your finances but also reinforce your commitment to delivering a well-managed event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent cancellation email examples\n\n\n\nNo two cancellations are the exact same, so please modify these event cancellation announcement examples to your needs. These can also be modified to fit other channels, like social media or a press release. Here are some solid places to get you started.\n\n\n\nExample #1: Cancellation of an event\n\n\n\nSubject: Important Update: This Year's Bash is Canceled\n\n\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\n\n\nWe hope this message finds you well.

And with the right event planning logistics, you can turn this wish into a success story. From choosing the perfect venue to coordinating with vendors, our guide on how to manage event logistics will cover everything you need to know to make sure your event runs smoothly! But first, let\u2019s take a look at what event logistics means.\n\n\n\nWhat is event logistics?\n\n\n\nEvent logistics is the secret recipe to cooking up a fantastic event! Think of it as the 'to-do list' that helps everything run seamlessly. From picking the right venue to making sure everyone knows where to be and when, event logistics is the game plan. For event organizers, getting this right means your event goes off without a hitch and everyone leaves with a smile.\n\n\n\nWhat you need to think about when managing event logistics\n\n\n\nWhen organizing an event, it\u2019s crucial to consider all those key details that can make a big difference. We\u2019ll break these examples of event logistics into manageable chunks to help you focus on what really counts!\n\n\n\n1. Venue\n\n\n\nWhen&nbsp;picking your venue, think about the vibe you're going for: formal, relaxed, or a mix. Then, size it up to ensure it can accommodate your guest list without them feeling cramped. You should try checking out the facilities. Maybe they've got some cool chairs or snazzy audio-visual gear you can use! But keep an eye on the price (including rental fees, service charges, etc.) so you find the perfect location within your budget. Also, don\u2019t forget to peek at reviews, as they can be a real eye-opener before you pay for the venue. If you're planning an outdoor event, have a Plan B tucked away for those raincloud surprises \u2014 like renting tents or marquees that you can quickly set up or reserving an indoor space nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Transportation\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need to ensure that all of your attendees can easily access your event, which means choosing a venue that\u2019s accessible by public transport. If your venue is close to the city, see how well your chosen venue connects by bus or train. And for remote spots, consider getting shuttle buses to help attendees arrive easily. You could also work with ride-sharing apps to offer special discounts for your event or set a spot for taxis. At the same time, you'll have people who\u2019ll want to drive themselves to the venue, so provide clear directions so they can get there no problem. Another idea is to suggest carpooling for attendees coming from the same area. Making sure everyone has easy and stress-free ways to get to your event will start things off right.\n\n\n\n3. Accessibility\n\n\n\nMaking sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable is key to a standout event! To do this, ensure you check for ramps or elevators for easy movement and clear signs to guide everyone. It's the little touches \u2014 like accessible restrooms, spaces friendly for those with sensory sensitivities, and even sign language interpreters \u2014 that show you've thought of everyone. For the digital side to your event logistics, like&nbsp;online registrations to learn about what special accommodations you may need, make sure to use a user-friendly platform like TicketLeap. After all, when everyone's included, the party's always better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Parking\n\n\n\nEnsuring your guests have a hassle-free parking experience is like giving them a warm welcome hug before they even step in! Ensure there's enough space for everyone; perhaps even throw in a valet service for that extra touch of class (depending on the event type). And if there\u2019s a parking fee, maybe cover it \u2014 or at least give your guests a heads-up. Also, consider your attendees' safety and select a well-lit area with a watchful eye or two to ensure everyone's peace of mind.\n\n\n\n5. Vendor\n\n\n\nClear communication is essential when working with vendors. It\u2019s your job as the event organizer to make sure that all of the vendors (be it food, drinks, entertainment, decor, or tech) are aware of their roles and the timeline leading to the event. If you\u2019ve got an&nbsp;event budget, ensure you choose the perfect partners that can give you the best value for your money. Before you choose a vendor, check out their online reviews to get a feel for their service, and have a chat to ensure they resonate with your event's mood. And remember that things change, so team up with adaptable vendors. Once you've found the right vendors, jot down the agreements, including contracts, pricing, and deliverables. With the best in each field, your event is bound to leave everyone raving!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Accommodation\n\n\n\nFor your out-of-town attendees, speakers, or staff members, finding a cozy spot nearby is key. Look into local hotels (maybe get a group discount), charming bed and breakfasts, or check out well-reviewed short-term rentals like Airbnb. If your event has that community feel, some local attendees might even offer a spare room or sofa. And don\u2019t forget to ensure there's easy transport back and forth from your venue. At the end of the day, well-rested guests bring the best vibes!\n\n\n\n7. Event staff\n\n\n\nGathering the perfect team is like assembling a dream band \u2014 everyone brings their unique tune! Start by pinpointing roles, from security to event coordinators. While experience is golden, a brief training session will ensure everyone dances to the same rhythm. Also, keep an eye out for team dynamics; when everyone gets along, they handle hiccups like pros. And remember, a feedback channel can come in handy, as your team's on-ground insights might just be the cherry on top of a fantastic event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best event planning logistics checklist\n\n\n\nTo help you manage your event logistics like a pro, we\u2019ve whipped up a simple checklist to keep things on track! Here\u2019s a checklist on how to manage event logistics:\n\n\n\n\nFind a cozy venue that aligns with your event's vibe.\n\n\n\nEnsure ample room for guests and activities.\n\n\n\nMap out how guests will get to your venue.\n\n\n\nNail down parking details and any team members who'll help direct traffic.\n\n\n\nConsider tech tools or apps like the TicketLeap mobile app for fast event guest check-ins.\n\n\n\nPrep badges, wristbands, or tokens in advance, if you're using them.\n\n\n\nRound up your must-have audio-visual equipment like mics, projectors, and cool lights.\n\n\n\nTest your equipment to ensure a glitch-free experience on event day.\n\n\n\nJot down a timeline for vendor arrivals and departures, as well as map out where they'll be stationed at your event.\n\n\n\nTouch base with your food and decor partners.\n\n\n\nAssign roles to your event crew.\n\n\n\nKeep everyone in the loop about their tasks.\n\n\n\nScout for clear paths and easy exits.\n\n\n\nSet up first-aid spots and ensure accessibility.\n\n\n\nPut up signs to guide your guests.\n\n\n\nHighlight key zones like restrooms, food stations, and activity hubs.\n\n\n\nPrepare for any last-minute switch-ups.\n\n\n\nSketch out a plan for unexpected twists \u2014 rain, power outages, or a missing cake!\n\n\n\nEnsure everyone stays comfy and cheerful.\n\n\n\nOrganize the pack-up brigade.\n\n\n\nDo a final sweep to ensure everything's in order.\n\n\n\n\nManage your event logistics better!\n\n\n\nYou're now fully equipped with the essentials of how to plan logistics for an event! And when it comes to&nbsp;event ticketing, TicketLeap can be your best buddy \u2014 making the process a breeze.

From small conferences to large festivals, prioritizing inclusivity ensures a positive experience for all attendees. Read on to learn how to make events more accessible at every stage \u2014 before, during, and after!\n\n\n\nWhy accessibility at events matters\n\n\n\nAccessibility at events isn't just about meeting legal standards, rather it's a key part of being an inclusive, respectful organizer. Accessible events are essential to ensure everyone can participate and enjoy them. This commitment not only aligns with the values of diversity and equality but also shows that you care about all attendees' experiences.\n\n\n\nHow to make your events more accessible before, during, and after\n\n\n\nWe'll show you how to include accessibility in events at each step of your planning process. Consider this your checklist for planning accessible meetings and events, ensuring inclusivity from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do before the event\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to make events more accessible during the initial planning stage:\n\n\n\n1. Send pre-event surveys\n\n\n\nSend out surveys to understand the specific needs of attendees, which can cover a wide range of accessibility concerns. TicketLeap lets you add custom registration questions at checkout to help you with these tasks. This way, ticket buyers can let you know about any special needs they may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Ensure the venue is well lit\n\n\n\nConsider the impact of strobes and dim lights on people with vision impairments, epilepsy, and those on the spectrum. Use clear signage for directions and locations. Additionally, ensure the visibility of projection screens from all seats in your event venue.\n\n\n\n3. Test venue accessibility\n\n\n\nCheck for nearby parking or public transit, elevator\/ramp access, and easily locatable gender-neutral bathrooms. Also, confirm the availability of electrical outlets for laptops and adaptive devices.\n\n\n\n4. Communicated accessibility info\n\n\n\nClearly communicate accessibility features in your event page and materials. Adding a simple line like \u2018our conference is wheelchair accessible\u2019 lets attendees with disabilities know what to expect. But ensure you use simple, readable text and include symbols that indicate available resources and accommodations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Check your event tech\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using an event app or website, ensure they are accessible to people with various disabilities\u2014including those who use assistive technologies.

Reevaluate your entrance fee\n\n\n\nConsider waiving the entrance fee for companions of guests with disabilities, as they are often essential for assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do during the event\n\n\n\nWondering how to make events more inclusive during the event? Here are a few tips to help!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Address individual needs\n\n\n\nStay proactive in addressing the varying needs of attendees. This includes ensuring sign language interpretation and catering to dietary restrictions. Communicate available services clearly in invites and announcements.\n\n\n\n2. Make communication lines accessible\n\n\n\nFor large events, setting up an \u201caccessibility desk\u201d near the entrance can provide direct support for attendees with disabilities. You can complement this by adding a dedicated hotline for assistance.\n\n\n\n3. Manage seating and layout\n\n\n\nPrioritize seating for persons with disabilities and ensure that pathways are free from obstructions. Doorways and aisles should be wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs, scooters, and service animals.\n\n\n\n4. Make presentations accessible\n\n\n\nEnsure that slides and presentations are accessible, with large fonts, high-quality images, and clear messaging. Consider offering audio descriptions and alternative formats like braille or large print materials.\n\n\n\n5. Provide a real-time feedback loop\n\n\n\nSet up a system for real-time feedback, such as a text line or app feature, allowing attendees to report accessibility issues immediately.\n\n\n\n6. Include accessibility ambassadors\n\n\n\nHave volunteers or staff specifically trained to assist with accessibility needs. Also, ensure they\u2019re easily identifiable by attendees.\n\n\n\n7. Create relaxed zones\n\n\n\nCreate areas where attendees can retreat from sensory overload, a key consideration for neurodivergent individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do after the event\n\n\n\nAccessibility continues even after your event ends! Follow these best practices for engaging with attendees afterward to maintain inclusivity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Provide inclusive event swag\n\n\n\nOffer swag items like T-shirts in neutral colors and various sizes, and consider the practicality of items for those traveling. Small, easy-to-carry items like laptop stickers can be a thoughtful choice.\n\n\n\n2. Collect feedback\n\n\n\nAfter your event, reach out to guests to enquire about their comfort and ability to participate fully. Use this feedback to learn and improve future events.\n\n\n\n3. Make sure your follow-up communications are inclusive\n\n\n\nEnsure all post-event communications, like thank you emails and surveys, are accessible and consider using multiple formats.\n\n\n\n4. Share your learnings\n\n\n\nIf you can, post a blog or report about the accessibility measures taken at the event and the outcomes. This will go a long way towards educating and inspiring others in the industry.\n\n\n\n5. Engage with the community\n\n\n\nBuild a community around your events that continue the conversation about accessibility and inclusivity, fostering ongoing improvements and advocacy.\n\n\n\nMake your events more accessible!\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered everything you need to know in this accessible events guide!

Include an event description with the location, bios of the performers, and all the important event information that the venue owners would want attendees to know (e.g., parking, when doors open, any age restrictions). Add links to the artists\u2019 music so people can listen, and embed videos on your ticketing page to make it even more engaging! This footage could be of their latest music video or live videos of the act's best moments at other concerts, giving customers a glimpse into how awesome your concert is sure to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Blast it on social media platforms\n\n\n\nSocial media marketing is extremely powerful in the music business! The key is to use your social media pages to attract people near the concert venue, tapping into tools like Facebook advertising and location tags on Instagram stories to target people who live nearby.\n\n\n\nPost engaging videos!\n\n\n\nCreating video content, especially of fun moments from past shows, can really get attendees excited for what's coming next. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts are perfect for this. Building promo videos around the show dates offers a fresh way to invite people to your event.\n\n\n\nIf you're promoting concerts while in the local area, make videos experiencing the sites and community around the venue. Share a stitch or use a local spotlight video to highlight what you're looking forward to experiencing at the show when you're in town. As the band, you could also post updates leading up to the concert and create content around just how epic the live music will be. When you make and post videos, make sure to encourage people to purchase tickets to your concert event! Tag the venue, artists, and any sponsors so each of them can share it with their audiences as well. And don't forget to use location-based hashtags!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake full advantage of your Facebook event\n\n\n\nMake sure to post on all your social media accounts, but remember that using Facebook for your concert marketing offers some unique ways to spotlight your upcoming events! First, you'll need to create your Facebook business page if you haven't already. Then, create a dedicated Facebook event page for your concert, and send it out to your followers so they can RSVP. That way, their friends will see that they're going and they'll want to go too (thanks FOMO!). Don't forget to post in local music-related Facebook groups for more visibility from fellow live music lovers.\n\n\n\nTap into digital ads\n\n\n\nIf you have a marketing budget, you can run paid ads on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok that target specific geographic regions and music interests. It's important to allocate some budget for retargeting too since most people won\u2019t buy tickets the first time they see your ad. Make sure your ads meet two criteria: the audience should live near the venue and have some prior knowledge of you, like watching a music video you posted. You might also consider using Google Ads to drive traffic to your website, focusing on keywords such as \u201cfolk music near me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Tap into your email list\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re a venue coordinator or an artist, it\u2019s important to build a strong following beyond just your social media presence. Your email list is a key way to do that. After all, these are the fans who are most invested in your story! Start by collecting people's emails on your own website through a sign-up form, and gather their zip codes too so you can segment your list based on location. Then, when you have a show nearby, you can email them to get them excited and encourage them to buy tickets.\n\n\n\nTo help grow your mailing list, offer incentives for people when they sign up, like a free sticker or song download. Consider doing a regular newsletter to keep your audience engaged with the latest news from your band or venue! Be sure to include a list of your upcoming gigs and remind them to get tickets. You can send personalized email invites or even send emails directly through TicketLeap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Leverage local SEO\n\n\n\nAs you book each show, keep your website up-to-date with all your concert details \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to boost your engagement with the power of SEO! If you're wondering what SEO is, it stands for Search Engine Optimization. This involves making improvements to your website, including by adding local keywords and phrases to help you easily appear in search results. That way, when people search for your band or are just looking for a cool concert near them, you\u2019ll show up! \n\n\n\nOn top of your website, don\u2019t forget to update your tour dates on Spotify as well. It's also a good idea to create a concert listing on local event directories and use third-party website integrations like Bandsintown or Seated. Finally, consider connecting with local influencers, event podcasts, and local websites to spread the word about your concerts.\n\n\n\n6. Market your show in person\n\n\n\nIn addition to promoting your concert online, there are plenty of ways to market your concert in person to drive even more ticket sales!\n\n\n\nCreate &amp; post eye-catching flyers\n\n\n\nOnce you've launched your ticketing page, you'll want to create physical flyers that include a QR code on it linking directly to your event page for easy access. You'll want to use large fonts, bold colors, and impressive images on your flyers to grab people's attention as they walk past. Once you've created your eye-catching flyers, distribute them in nearby communities, especially in locations close to the venue itself. This could include coffee shops, universities, and local businesses (with their permission of course!). Don't forget to leverage local event listings and community boards too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecruit a street team\n\n\n\nOne effective way to market your concert is to create a \"street team\" to hand out flyers, stickers, and other promotional materials for your upcoming event. This team can target high-traffic areas, popular local spots, and other live events where potential concert-goers are likely to be. Consider recruiting volunteers by offering them free admission, backstage passes, or exclusive merchandise in exchange for their help. With the help of your concert promoters, you can create a buzz and significantly boost attendance at your concert.\n\n\n\nPromote at other local shows\n\n\n\nFor artists, make sure to promote your concert at other events or gigs you might also have in the area. Take some time during your setlist to mention your next round of shows and where fans can find more information (e.g., your website, on social media). This is the perfect opportunity since the audience is already listening to you and loving what they\u2019re hearing! Additionally, consider booking a local opening act to draw in their audience as well as your own, especially if they're in the same genre. This way, they can also promote your show at their gigs too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet local businesses involved\n\n\n\nWant to take your concert marketing a step further? Try asking local organizations for help! More specifically, research if there are any local arts communities you can tap into. Ask if they\u2019ll give your upcoming events a shoutout, share your concert on their newsletters or in a blog post, and add your concert in the program for their shows. Also, have the sponsors of your venue or event spread the word about your upcoming concert too, and consider letting them give away some tickets to loyal customers in their audiences.\n\n\n\n7. Get the local media involved\n\n\n\nYou can get great exposure through TV appearances on local news and lifestyle shows, along with being featured on news websites, alternative publications, or blogs. Consider writing up a press release about your upcoming concert to share with all the media outlets as well. It's also super helpful to have an electronic press kit (EPK) from the musician or band to share along with your sample article detailing your concert. Shoutouts on TV and radio are awesome too. So, reach out to local music stations and podcasts, and they might even do ticket giveaways on air!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus tips on concert promotion!\n\n\n\nLooking for another effective strategy or two to promote concerts you've got coming up? We've got a bonus round of tactics for you to test out!\n\n\n\n\nHost a ticket giveaway on social media, where people tag 2-3 friends they'd like to go with to your concerts to be in the running for some free tickets (and maybe even a meet &amp; greet with the band!).\n\n\n\nThrow a contest for people to create their own TikToks, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts using the band's latest song. Pick your favorites, and give them free tickets to your next concert near them as their prize!\n\n\n\nTo encourage people to act fast, try using discounts on tickets for exclusive promotional campaigns.\n\n\n\nEngage with local influencers to help spread the word and generate buzz around your concert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s your time to shine!\n\n\n\nNow you know how to advertise a concert! As we talked about, you\u2019ll want to tap into a wide range of channels, from email marketing to in-person tactics, to ensure you bring in as many fans to your next live show as possible. Plus, understanding how to promote a concert on social media effectively will be essential to reaching an even wider audience. For the record, you don\u2019t have to brave this journey alone.

A Halloween fundraiser presents unique opportunities to connect with your community, boost visibility, and secure vital funds for your nonprofit's mission.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement\n\n\n\nHalloween events can captivate attendees of all ages! Not only do they bring people together over a shared love for all things Halloween, they also help connect your organization with those in your community who might not have otherwise heard about you. Fun activities such as costume contests, haunted houses, trunk-or-treat fundraisers, and themed games can help draw in people from all walks of life, setting the stage for an inclusive atmosphere.\n\n\n\nIncreased visibility\n\n\n\nHalloween fundraiser ideas can really make your nonprofit stand out and get noticed in a crowded market! Seasonal events are super shareable on social media, boosting your organization's online presence and drawing in new supporters who may not have known about your cause before.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEffective fundraising\n\n\n\nThe festive nature of Halloween-themed fundraisers makes it easier to incorporate creative fundraising activities such as raffles or auctions. They\u2019re also a great reason to sell tickets to haunt-related events like pumpkin patches. These can significantly amp up your fundraising efforts, allowing you to raise more money to support your nonprofit organization.\n\n\n\nHalloween-themed fundraiser ideas for inspiration:\n\n\n\n1. Spooky-themed bake sale\n\n\n\nWin over your community with a classic bake sale! For this fundraising idea, homemade baked goods are sold to raise money for your cause. This idea works particularly well because it\u2019s simple and appeals to anyone with a sweet tooth (which is a lot of people!). To put a spooky spin on your goodies, add designs like ghosts, witches, pumpkins, or bats with icing and fondant. Go the extra mile by incorporating fall-inspired flavors like pumpkin spice, caramel apple, or Halloween candy corn! When you\u2019re ready to spread the word, post about your bake sale on social media and share it with groups that are known to support your cause. Post flyers promoting your bake sale on local community boards to draw in more people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Haunted house tour\n\n\n\nA haunted house fundraiser can be a super creative way to sell tickets and fundraise for your cause. Start by selecting a suitable location with ample space for different scenes and props. Once your venue is secured, design a layout that guides visitors through a series of themed rooms filled with eerie lighting, spooky sound effects, and creepy decorations. Utilize your volunteers to add interactive elements like jump scares and hidden surprises. Lastly, it\u2019s extremely important to ensure that your haunted house venue meets necessary safety standards and that your volunteers are trained on emergency procedures to ensure a fun, safe haunted house event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Pumpkin carving contest\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for attendees to participate and get creative, then a pumpkin carving contest is the Halloween fundraiser for you! Participants can purchase an event ticket to enter the contest and those ticket proceeds can be used to fundraise for your cause. Pumpkin carving attracts participants of all ages, from college students to large families. To get this fundraiser up and running, set clear contest rules and categories like the scariest, funniest, and most creative. To take your contest a step further, give out prizes like gift cards donated by local businesses or sponsors that support your charity!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Pumpkin patch\n\n\n\nSimilar to our pumpkin contest theme, consider putting together a pumpkin patch! You can easily buy pumpkins in bulk from a local wholesale farmer and sell them at a more premium price to raise money for your nonprofit. Decorate your pumpkin patch with fall-inspired backdrops for the perfect photo op! Think bales of hay, autumn leaves, scarecrows, and aesthetic pumpkin arrangements. Add to your fundraiser by selling pumpkin decorating supplies! To make your pumpkin patch even more worthwhile, invite local businesses to sell snacks and beverages like apple cider, hot chocolate, and pumpkin treats!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Trick-or-treat trail\n\n\n\nTrick-or-treat fundraiser ideas are some fun ones to try! Consider a trick-or-treat trail where you plan a route with designated stops so participants can collect treats or play mini-games like cornhole or apple bobbing. Utilize all the spooky props you can think of on your trail like fog machines, cool lighting, and sound effects to create the perfect eerie atmosphere. To ensure your trail is followed as planned, create maps or provide signage to guide participants along the path and indicate crossing points. You can use the proceeds from your event ticket sales to support your selected charity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Costume parade\n\n\n\nBring the spirit of a good ol\u2019 Halloween party to the streets with a costume parade! A costume parade allows your participants to show off their personalities and design skills. You can work with your city to plan a route through a central location like a downtown area or community park. To add an extra level of fun, turn it into a costume contest with categories for different age groups or themes, like best group or most original costume. To boost ticket sales, collaborate with community organizations and schools to sponsor your upcoming Halloween fundraiser and offer prizes to the winners of your contest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Horror movie screening\n\n\n\nFor these Halloween charity events, choose popular horror films or classic Halloween movies to show and sell a ticket to enter. You can even show them back-to-back as a movie marathon event and section them off in themes such as slasher, supernatural, or family-friendly. Be sure to schedule breaks in between films for the restroom, concessions, and a good ol\u2019 stretch. To set the mood, offer themed snacks such as vampire-themed cocktails (or mocktails) and caramel popcorn. Your screening area could even be decorated with cobwebs and jack-o\u2019-lanterns!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. DIY Halloween craft fair\n\n\n\nCalling all creatives! Invite your local artisans, crafters, and DIY enthusiasts to showcase and sell their Halloween-themed items. Set up booth spaces for vendors to share their artwork with your community. Then, to promote your craft fair, contact local media outlets, share it on community calendars, and blast it across your social media platforms. Put together a raffle where attendees can pay to enter and win a basket of sponsored items from local artists. To spice things up, provide opportunities for attendees to participate in hands-on crafting workshops to create their own Halloween-inspired decorations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Ghostly gala dinner\n\n\n\nA gala dinner is a super popular charity event idea, so why not make it Halloween-themed? Design a themed menu featuring dishes inspired by Halloween folklore, ghost stories, and other aspects of fall. Offer appetizers like deviled eggs with spider web designs, main courses like pumpkin risotto, and desserts like graveyard-themed cakes. Make your gala interactive by having volunteers read ghost stories, or set up fortune-telling stations with tarot card readings for after dinner. To benefit your nonprofit, set up a silent auction to raise funds for your cause while providing an unforgettable night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Zombie fun run\n\n\n\nWho would\u2019ve thought you could purposely invite zombies to run for a good cause! For this fundraising event, host a charity run but with a twist \u2013 everyone dresses up like zombies. Choose a scenic route or park for your zombie fun run, and even consider featuring different distances and difficulty levels depending on your runners\u2019 experience. To build your event\u2019s momentum, encourage early sign-ups using early-bird discounts and reward runners for hitting fundraising goals through pledges. Want to take your run up a notch? Consider seeking sponsorships for support and offer cool merchandise like T-shirts and hats to elevate your charity event's appeal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Witch's brew tasting\n\n\n\nCollaborate with local breweries or distilleries to offer tasting flights! Then, either have the brewery donate a percentage of the proceeds to your selected cause or donate the drinks they share with attendees in exchange for promotional opportunities at your event. Work with your sponsor to brainstorm names that\u2019ll witch-ify your drink selections to match your theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Monster mash chili bash\n\n\n\nHost a Halloween-themed chili contest! Invite your local community to purchase a ticket to your chili-tasting event. For your contestants, start by setting Halloween-themed categories like \u201cSpiciest Hellfire\u201d (spiciest chili), \u201cBest Overall Cauldron\u201d (best overall chili), \u201cWickedly Vegetarian\u201d (best vegetarian), \u201cPhantom\u2019s Favorite\u201d (people\u2019s choice), and so on. Decorate your contestants' booths in different Halloween-themed ways to add to the spooky atmosphere and encourage them to bring their own themed cookware! As for your tasting attendees, create engaging activities like a \u201cchili passport\u201d and offer a prize to the attendees who have received a stamp for tasting every booth's chili!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Jack-o'-lantern auction\n\n\n\nLight up the night with a Jack-o\u2019-Lantern auction! Engage local artists, influencers, and community members to create pumpkins out of wood, glass, or any material they choose and put their artistic spin on them. Then, showcase your decked-out pumpkins at a public spot or online gallery for auction for your cause. Provide clear guidance on pumpkin size, carving techniques, and submission deadlines. Lastly, throw a lively auction event with a skilled auctioneer or emcee to spark spirited bidding and attract competitive offers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Spooky scavenger hunt\n\n\n\nEngage your community with a spooky scavenger hunt! Craft a set of clues and riddles leading participants to different spots in your area. Hunt down unique sites with history or cool landmarks to include on the scavenger hunt path. Add a spooky touch with ghost stories, urban legends, or historical trivia tied to the spots. Toss in rewards like gift cards, event tickets, or Halloween-themed goodies for those who complete the hunt successfully! All participants can purchase a ticket to your spooky scavenger hunt, and you can donate the proceeds to your selected nonprofit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Creepy carnival&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFood and games? Yes, please! Create carnival booths and classic attractions with a twist using Halloween themes! This could include a haunted house corn maze, pumpkin bowling, or a witch's hat ring toss. Have your staff or volunteers run the booths for a range of games for all ages so everyone can enjoy the fun. To benefit your fundraising efforts, sell tickets for carnival entry and game access. You can mix free and paid activities, as well as offer tickets or tokens for games. Have local vendors offer concession stands with snacks, drinks, and Halloween treats for additional funds!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe hope these ideas have you antsy to get your own Halloween-themed fundraiser off the ground!

It's the roadmap that guides event planners through the financial landscape of event planning, ensuring that every penny spent is accounted for and driving towards a successful outcome. Want to manage event budgets like a pro? We've got the tips and strategies you need for creating an event budget that'll fully prepare you for your next event, along with a free template for you to use!\n\n\n\nWhat is an event budget?\n\n\n\nAn event budget provides you the full event cost breakdown of your anticipated expenses against the revenue you expect to generate. Having an event budget proposal fleshed out will help you determine how much you should spend on things like venue booking, marketing, and staffing to stay within those budget constraints. Depending on how much revenue you plan to bring in, you'll need to be realistic with your spending in order to make a profit. With the help of a smartly-made event planning budget, you'll have a blueprint for what's feasible and what's not!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of event budgeting\n\n\n\nWith an event budget spreadsheet, you'll have way more control as an event planner over the financial aspects of your event. That way, you can ensure you're not overspending and know when you have wiggle room to spend a little more in certain areas. Managing expenses forces you to prioritize what you\u2019re willing to pay more for by sacrificing something else. You can also see how much cash flow you have to cover expenses as they come in.\n\n\n\nWith an event budget to keep you in check, you'll keep a clear record of all the actual expenses you're incurring and the revenue you\u2019re bringing in. Now more than ever, budget planning is super important as event planners' budgets get smaller amidst prices continuing to increase across the event industry. The decisions you make for your upcoming event will rely heavily on what fits into your total event budget.\n\n\n\nThen, by the end of your event, you can gauge your event's financial performance to see if you got the return on investment (ROI) you were shooting for. Your sponsors will also appreciate seeing their ROI from supporting your event as well. Plus, tracking all your revenue and expenses in a corporate event budget will also be extremely helpful later when tax season comes around!\n\n\n\nWhen should you create a budget for your event?\n\n\n\nThe sooner, the better! Your budget should be drafted as soon as you've confirmed that you'll be putting on an event, ideally during the brainstorming phases of your event planning. This early financial planning ensures that you're well informed that all major decisions are accounted for in your available total budget, preventing any potential overspending and allowing you to be strategic in how you use your funds. Most importantly, you'll want to get your event budget proposal finalized before making the major purchases for your event, such as venue rental, speaker fees, and other larger venue costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential steps for planning event budgets\n\n\n\nReady to build an event planning budget, but not sure where to start? We'll walk you through each event budget step, so you feel more prepared when you create your own. Let's jump right in!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Define your event goals and objectives\n\n\n\nWhen organizing an event, it's crucial that your financial planning aligns with the overarching goals you've set out to achieve. Your budget should be structured in such a way that it supports these targets, whether you're wanting to make a profit or simply need to break even. Think about the big picture of your event. What are your overall objectives? Is the purpose of this event to raise brand awareness? To bring your community together? To fundraise for a cause? Understanding the necessary costs to achieve these goals is essential in creating a budget that not only aligns with, but actively supports your event's success!\n\n\n\nStep 2: Assessing your event\u2019s scope\n\n\n\nAs you build your budget, it's crucial to account for the size and complexity of your event when projecting its related costs. You'll also want to get a good estimate of how many people might show up and get a sense of who they are. Predicting attendee numbers and understanding their demographics will help you forecast the more variable costs like food, drinks, and seating accommodations. Determining this now will help you prepare for the extent of your event's needs, from how many staff members to recruit to how big of a venue you'll need.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Identify and allocate funds for all potential event expenses\n\n\n\nTo start off, list every possible cost your event might incur, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nStaff costs\n\n\n\nVenue costs\n\n\n\nEquipment rentals\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nEvent marketing\n\n\n\nFood and catering services\n\n\n\nVolunteer expenses\n\n\n\nTravel and accommodation\n\n\n\nSecurity services\n\n\n\nWaste management\n\n\n\nDecorations\n\n\n\nInsurance costs\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've gotten those costs outlined, review data from previous events, or if this is your first event, do some market research to ballpark each expense. You'll want to sort your costs into two buckets: fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are those like the venue or equipment rental, which don't change whether you're hosting 10 or 100 people. On the other hand, variable costs, like food or staffing, definitely will change depending on the number of people you have. Remember, it\u2019s totally cool if your initial estimates aren\u2019t spot-on. A rough estimate is way better than no estimate at all. Plus, you can always tweak those numbers once you start getting actual quotes from your vendors. Keep things flexible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Identify all revenue streams\n\n\n\nNext, time to figure out how much cash you might bring in from different sources like ticket sales, donations, and sponsorships. Depending on what your costs are compared to your projected number of attendees, this will help you determine the ticket price levels to make a profit. You'll want to set your prices such that you're able to cover your expenses, but still low enough that people will be willing to buy them. Feel free to pick the brains of seasoned event pros to double-check your estimates. Then, with TicketLeap\u2019s powerful reporting tools, it's super easy to gauge how well your ticket sales are doing at different price levels, once they're on sale.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Establish a realistic budget\n\n\n\nWith all your projected expenses and revenue in a row, it's time to plug all your estimates into a template. During the early stages of your event planning, it could be helpful to create a few versions of this budget that adjust your variable expenses according to different numbers of attendees you may expect (e.g., costs for 100 vs. 300 people). To turn a profit, you'll need to keep your expenses lower than your revenue. For example, you could look at boosting your income through various channels like sales, sponsorships, exhibitor booth fees, and merchandise. On the flip side, think about ways to cut costs. Could you use a venue your organization already owns instead of renting one? What about opting for organizing a potluck instead of splurging on catering? And don't forget to evaluate your options for entertainment or speakers carefully. Every decision counts!\n\n\n\nGet a FREE event budget template! Simply click the button below, and it\u2019s all yours! \n\n\n\n\nDownload Now!\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Track expenses and make adjustments\n\n\n\nIt might take some extra work now, but keeping track of every dollar spent and earned is going to pay off big time down the line! We suggest having your team hold onto all receipts and make sure every expense or bit of revenue gets documented in a spreadsheet either within or separate from your event budgeting template. Remember to keep your budget flexible so you can adapt to what you thought you'd spend and what you actually spend. Trust us, it's a smart move to hold onto your receipts and keep detailed records, not just for budgeting reasons. They'll be super handy when it's time to do your taxes down the road!\n\n\n\nHow do you stay on budget for an event?\n\n\n\nIt's one thing to create a budget for an event. It's another thing entirely to stick to it. Having a solid event plan template in place is the essential first step to greater financial control, but there are also some other ways to ensure you stay within your margins. Here are some tips to help your event budget management!\n\n\n\n1. Compare and negotiate vendor quotes\n\n\n\nTo get the most bang for your buck, research and collect detailed quotes from various vendors of your major expenses, such as the venue you'll book. It's all about comparing their estimated prices to make sure you're getting the best deal. And remember, never just go with the first quote that comes your way! There's always room for a little negotiation with suppliers to snag better rates or packages, especially when you've got options to compare. Don't hesitate to tell the vendors you're comparing prices to try and work out the best offer for your event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Consider do-it-yourself alternatives\n\n\n\nWanting to save some extra money? Take a moment to think about what aspects of your event you can handle on your own instead of paying someone else to do it. Managing tasks yourself (and with your event staff!) like post-event cleaning, traffic control, or handling merchandise sales can help keep costs low, even if it takes a little more time. You could also get creative with various DIY decorations for your venue. It's all about figuring out what you're capable of doing yourself versus what you might need a little help with!\n\n\n\n3. Utilize free or low-cost options\n\n\n\nTake advantage of the resources you already have available! When it comes to staying on budget, tap into your local community for vendors, venue locations, and more. Rather than hiring a team to help at your event, you could scout out volunteers who can lend a hand in exchange for free admission into your event. You might also want to check out public venues or look for local partnerships that could offer you services at no cost.\n\n\n\nWith needs like audio visual equipment or other event technology, the big question you'll ask is whether to buy or rent. To determine what's best for you, think about if buying will save you money in the long run, especially if you plan to use it at future events. Otherwise, renting for a one-off event may be more suitable for your needs. When it comes to your ticketing, pick a powerful platform that's also super affordable. TicketLeap offers completely free ticketing software to event organizers, which means one less expense for you to think about!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Plan for unexpected expenses\n\n\n\nAs your event planning becomes reality, you should always set aside a contingency fund to cover unexpected costs that arise. Even for the expenses you're anticipating, the actual costs you may incur could be more than you initially planned at times, especially if it's your first time hosting an event. Plus, it's always wise to have a little extra cash tucked away just in case! A good rule of thumb? Set aside around 10-15% of your total budget for these unexpected expenses. It's like having a safety net, ensuring you're covered no matter what comes your way. And hey, if you don't end up needing it, you've got a little bonus left over!\n\n\n\nIt's your turn to build an event budget!\n\n\n\nNow, you know how to create an event budget! Remember, the perfect event budget is one that flexibly accommodates the twists and turns of event planning while keeping your financial goals clearly in sight.

Whether it's for personal or professional development, workshops are a valuable experience for attendees to learn new skills, network with others, and grow in knowledge together. Ready to learn how to organize a workshop of your own? In this article, we're here to provide expert tips that'll help you host a successful workshop from start to finish!\n\n\n\nWhy host a workshop?\n\n\n\nHosting a workshop event is a fantastic way to bring people together to learn and grow, providing participants the opportunity to acquire new skills in a supportive environment. Workshops offer a unique platform for individuals to expand their knowledge and enhance their skill sets, making them more confident in areas that interested them.\n\n\n\nThat's not all! Hosting classes is also about community building. They create a welcoming space where people, possibly nervous about trying new things among strangers, can feel more at ease. When done right, your workshop can facilitate networking and forge new friendships too. Participants get to meet like-minded individuals, share ideas, and collaborate. Plus, it may lead to future opportunities for your attendees! Whether it's gaining new skills, making new friends, or both, workshops have something valuable to offer to everyone who takes part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the best format for your workshop\n\n\n\nWhen planning your workshop, take the time to research popular formats within your niche and customize them to meet the needs of your target audience. Depending on the topic, you may host your workshop as a hands-on craft session, a skills-focused masterclass, or a lively panel discussion. There's a range of workshop types to choose from, such as skill-based sessions that are perfect for hands-on learning like cooking or cake decorating, informative workshops on topics like social media marketing, or interactive discussions that delve into the latest industry trends.\n\n\n\nIn-person or online?\n\n\n\nThe next important piece is to determine if you should host your workshop in-person or online. Both formats offer unique benefits! Online workshops allow for recordable sessions, interactive polls, a wider audience reach, and greater flexibility for the speakers you'd draw in. On the other hand, in-person workshops provide invaluable networking opportunities, more hands-on activities, and a more interactive learning experience. For in-person events, selecting a venue that accommodates your expected number of attendees comfortably is key. You'll want to make sure the venue can support your technical support needs, engage attendees in meaningful conversations, and have the essential tools to carry out your workshop demonstrations.\n\n\n\nCan't decide which one is best? Try a hybrid approach! You can sell tickets to a livestream of your in-person workshop, combining the best of both worlds! By balancing the perks of both online and in-person formats, you can create an engaging and accessible learning experience for all your participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey performance indicators\n\n\n\nFinding a few ways to measure the success of your workshop event is important to really capturing its impact. Knowledge sharing is what hosting workshops is all about, fostering an environment where ideas and insights flow freely. Lead generation is another critical factor, as it signifies the ability to attract new prospects and opportunities, especially in the networking component of your events. Brand awareness is equally important, indicating how well you've managed to imprint your identity in the minds of your participants. Networking opportunities provided during the event act as a litmus test for its effectiveness in bringing people together and forging meaningful connections too. Lastly, your workshop\u2019s success is in helping build community, showing your ability to create a supportive and engaging environment that lasts well beyond the event itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet a date and time for your workshop\n\n\n\nPlanning your next workshop or seminar and wondering how long it should be? The key lies in understanding the depth of your topic. Opt for an hour to a half-day session if you're introducing a new concept or idea \u2014 it's perfect for giving attendees a taste without overwhelming them. However, if you're diving deep and offering extensive training, a multi-day event or series of events will ensure that participants walk away with a comprehensive understanding.\n\n\n\nWhen scheduling your event, consider your audience's availability. Weekends or evenings are generally best for working professionals and to steer clear of school hours for student attendees. But don't just guess! Use tools like polls on social media to get direct insight into your attendees' preferences. Lastly, a word to the wise: do some extra research to avoid major scheduling conflicts in your area. You don\u2019t want to schedule your workshop during big local events or holidays, where others may have prior commitments. Maximizing attendance is all about timing, so make sure your event stands out by choosing the most accessible date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a budget for your event\n\n\n\nCreating a budget is essential when you start planning your next workshop. Start by jotting down all the possible expenses \u2013 think venue rental, speaker fees, refreshments, marketing, and any tech or supplies needed. Don't forget to factor in a little extra for unexpected costs; they always pop up! Once you've got your list, do some research or reach out for quotes to get realistic figures. Then, tally it all up and compare it with the funds you have or expect from ticket sales, sponsors, and more. It might take a bit of tweaking to get everything to fit, but with a clear budget in hand, you'll be on your way to organizing an event that's both memorable and financially manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan the workshop agenda and schedule\n\n\n\nWhen planning an engaging workshop, the secret lies in an exciting flow that keeps attendees hooked from start to finish. Begin by mixing up lectures with interactive activities, fitting in time for fun introductions, sprinkling in breaks for networking, and setting aside time for Q&amp;A sessions. And of course, don't forget those highly-anticipated lunch or dinner breaks! Remember, shorter, focused sessions of about 20-30 minutes pack a more significant punch than drawn-out marathon lectures. This way, you ensure that the content remains digestible and retains the audience's attention throughout.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule and share your agenda with attendees well in advance, so they know what to expect. Additionally, listing out your technical and A\/V needs for each session will help you avoid last-minute hiccups, especially if you\u2019ll need slides, props, or other materials to enhance your presentation. And a pro tip: since people's most unproductive time tends to be between 2-3pm, try to schedule your most engaging content for the morning and late afternoon instead. Or, should you have a session during this window, keep the energy up with a coffee break!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate downloadable materials for participants\n\n\n\nMake sure the valuable knowledge you share sticks with your attendees after the workshop ends! One effective way to keep the information alive is by creating different types of handouts, like key takeaway summaries, cheat sheets, or templates that attendees can easily refer back to. You could also spice things up by offering bonus downloadable materials just for those who registered beforehand. That way, they can better prepare for what your workshop has in store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild an exclusive landing page for your workshop\n\n\n\nCreating a dedicated landing page to sell tickets to your workshop is an absolute must. Make sure you've got an irresistible event description to capture the key benefits that attendees will gain. Lay out all the necessary information and expectations for your workshop. Will supplies be provided, or should attendees bring their own? If you're supplying materials, consider embedding the cost into the ticket price to help your bottom line. On your ticketing page, don't forget to showcase your speaker bios if you have guest speakers, provide location details or the link for virtual events, and spice up the page with videos and photos to ramp up excitement for your event!\n\n\n\nWant to create the ticketing page of your dreams? Use TicketLeap's powerful ticketing software to get the job done right! Use our checkout questions that help you understand how attendees discovered your workshop, or send email reminders with all the essential details to prepare them for the day. Whatever your workshop's ticketing needs may be, we've got you covered!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing your workshop to drive registrations\n\n\n\nSocial media is your best ally when it comes to your workshop's marketing strategy! Kickstart the buzz by sharing engaging snippets, insightful thoughts on the workshop's topic (like on Instagram!), and using relevant hashtags across all your social media channels. Consider creating short, helpful video clips for TikTok to spark interest among enthusiasts of your topic. You can also amplify your reach through targeted ads on these platforms, ensuring you connect with your ideal attendees seamlessly. \n\n\n\nDon't underestimate the power of email marketing to engage your existing audience too! Platforms like TicketLeap offer built-in email marketing tools in our suite of features, making it easier to communicate with registered attendees and boost your event's visibility. Make it a point to send out personalized email invites to past attendees, especially if you're hosting advanced-level workshops. Segmenting your email list based on interests can significantly increase engagement rates and ensure your message resonates with the right crowd too.\n\n\n\nLastly, everyone loves a good deal! Offering early bird discounts, half-price promo codes, and exclusive perks for those who refer their friends can help you sell more tickets and bring in more people eager to learn. Thanks to TicketLeap's user-friendly software, you can launch special discounts on your tickets in no time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage networking\n\n\n\nTo foster a sense of community and encourage collaboration in your events, consider using breakout rooms in online workshops or setting aside specific networking time during in-person gatherings. Planning fun team-building games can be a great way to build community, boost teamwork, and kickstart conversations among participants. Starting your workshop with a lively icebreaker activity is another fantastic way to encourage conversations from the get-go. Additionally, creating a dedicated online forum or Facebook group for attendees to connect after the workshop can keep the momentum going, allowing the connections made during your event to continue flourishing long after it's over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering feedback and evaluations for future workshops\n\n\n\nIt's a great idea to sprinkle in some feedback points to engage with participants and gather their insights in real time. Following the workshop, send out post-event surveys to collect a wealth of information about the attendee's experience. With this, you can determine what was successful and what areas need work. By analyzing this feedback, you can pinpoint specific areas for improvement, ensuring that future workshops are even more effective and enjoyable for everyone involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up and continued engagement with attendees\n\n\n\nAfter the workshop concludes, make it a priority as the event organizer to send thank-you emails to all your participants, expressing gratitude for their attendance and sharing resources for them to further their studies. Any valuable workshop materials you shared in your workshop, make sure to share with them afterwards to apply what they've learned. Additionally, don't be shy to notify them about future workshops, especially if it\u2019s about relevant topics! That way, you'll keep them in the loop and encourage continuous learning with each new session you host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore tool tips specifically for online workshops\n\n\n\nFor virtual workshops specifically, it's a smart move to do a test run with your chosen platform before broadcasting the real deal. This step helps you smooth out any technical hitches, ensuring everything runs just right on the day. Also, give your tech a little extra TLC! Investing in high-quality audio and video equipment can make a huge difference, providing a seamless online experience that keeps your attendees hooked. And remember, interaction is key to keeping the energy up and your audience engaged. Use polls, Q&amp;A sessions, and breakout rooms into smaller groups to make your workshop not just informative, but also interactive and fun for your attendees participating from miles away!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, it's your turn!\n\n\n\nReady to transform your workshop idea into reality?

With the proper preparation, this process can be super simple. Luckily for you, we\u2019ve put together a thorough post-event cleanup checklist to make wrapping up your awesome event as easy as possible!\n\n\n\nBenefits of a thorough cleaning checklist&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs with anything, having a solid plan of what you need to do beforehand makes getting those things done a whole lot easier. With a detailed checklist of all the cleaning duties to complete at the end of your event, you can easily delegate tasks to your event staff so everyone is on the same page. This adds a bit more structure to the cleaning process and saves people from wondering what they should be doing to help after your event day wraps up. You as the event creator also receive peace of mind knowing that no stone is left unturned when it comes to cleaning requests from the venue space.\n\n\n\nBe sure to tailor your event cleaning checklist to your specific event venue to ensure all unique spaces are accounted for. You may even want to schedule a brief meeting with the venue\u2019s coordinator to clarify these exact needs. This reduces the chances of potential garbage or damage fees from your venue and fosters your relationship with them to hopefully use the venue again for your future events! After the event, you\u2019ll be confident you fully wrapped up the amazing experience you just curated, knowing that the cleanup is all taken care of.\n\n\n\nMaintaining a clean environment is crucial for ensuring a welcoming and enjoyable experience for guests! Not only will your post event cleaning checklist help you after the event, but it will also help you keep tabs on what to maintain during the event. Your guests will appreciate your attention to detail in the long run!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for post-event cleaning\n\n\n\nFirst things first, discuss post-event clean-up with your venue ahead of time. You may find out if the cost of your venue includes clean-up services, or they may have services you can add on for a fee. If not, ask what their expectations are when it comes to cleaning. In this conversation, you should ask if they have their own post-event checklist for you to follow. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to make one yourself based on your notes from them. Next, be sure to locate where the cleaning supplies are in the venue, and determine if there\u2019s any additional cleaning supplies you\u2019ll need to gather before event day. Is there a carpet? Will you need a vacuum? What types of surfaces are there? Wood or stainless steel? These are just a few factors you\u2019ll want to consider when gathering the types of necessary cleaning supplies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPro tip: store your supplies in a concealed yet easy-to-find place so your team can quickly retrieve them after your event. The sooner they can grab the supplies, the faster the cleaning process will be! Beforehand, discuss with your event staff who\u2019s responsible for what during and after the event. Assign responsibilities like trash can duty or spill cleanup to distribute the tasks in a manageable way for your staff. Lastly, have a clear guideline for when post-event cleanup starts and ends, especially if the venue needs it done by a certain time.\n\n\n\nDuring the event&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf your venue doesn\u2019t include janitorial services, you\u2019ll need to determine who on your event staff will be responsible for refilling paper towels, soap, and emptying trash cans among other related tasks. You\u2019ll want to be sure to maintain the tidiness of the main event area as well. This is especially important for long events that span over a few days, like a festival.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-event cleaning checklist&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrum roll, please!

In a few sentences, tell them what your event is all about. Be clear yet concise when explaining your value proposition: why should they come to your event? For example, if you're hosting a local festival, they'll be jamming out and making unforgettable memories with friends and family. If you want to\u00a0optimize your event website\u00a0even further, upload images and videos that pack a punch, make sure your site looks good on both desktop and mobile, and\u00a0link out to your socials. With all these added details, it'll be easy for potential attendees to search and find your event tickets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create your event ticket types\n\n\n\nEnsure you've taken full advantage of the many&nbsp;benefits of your event ticketing platform&nbsp;including multiple ticket types (like general admission, timed entry, and VIP),&nbsp;event registration&nbsp;questions, and ticket offerings to multiple performances or time slots. You'll need to set your ticket price levels too, of course! If you're hosting a charity event, you could even create tickets that'll help you collect additional donations for your cause. You should also create various types of discount codes to help promote your events as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Set up how you'll get paid\n\n\n\nBefore your event goes live, you'll need to set up the payment method for your ticket sales. To do so, simply connect your bank account information to your ticketing platform and get paid via direct deposit. Typically, you'll receive payment a few business days after your event is over, so you can put the funds straight back into your event business. It\u2019s that simple! One last thing: you'll want to verify that whichever ticketing platform you choose is super secure in handling your customer data and your financial information. For example, TicketLeap is backed by Stripe, an industry-leading payment processor known for its security and reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:&nbsp;Launch your ticket sales!\n\n\n\nOnce you've created your event page, now you're ready to start selling tickets online! Once your ticket sales are live, be sure the link to your ticketing page is posted all across your social media and website, so people know it's time to buy tickets and can get theirs easily. As the event organizer, the best way you're going to get people to purchase tickets to your event is to shout it from the rooftops, so make sure you\u2019re sharing it wherever you can!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Promote your event\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;best way to sell event tickets online&nbsp;is to build buzz with a multi-pronged marketing plan including&nbsp;social media promotion, email blasts,&nbsp;sponsorships, and more. To sell the most tickets, be sure to start promoting your event months ahead of time and carry these efforts through event day.\n\n\n\nLooking for ways to bolster your&nbsp;event marketing strategy? Consider creating high-quality content of lineup announcements, giveaways, contests, and exclusive behind-the-scenes sneak peaks of your event to share across your social posts. Be sure to post to Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to draw in as many new potential ticket buyers as possible. Or, even consider offline promotion like putting up flyers across town to bring in more people from your area. Be sure to add our auto-generated QR codes to your flyers so passersby can quickly scan and buy tickets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Send out email invites and reminders\n\n\n\nLet's dive more into how to sell tickets online using email marketing, shall we? To build a buzz from the start, launch an email campaign to past attendees or newsletter subscribers to let them know about your next awesome event. You could also send personalized event invitation emails to get potential attendees excited to purchase their tickets.\n\n\n\nThanks to TicketLeap's built-in email marketing platform, you can send out these emails straight from our system, including an automated email reminder 24 hours before your event starts. In these emails, be sure to share important details on parking, admissions, and more helpful tips to make the event day experience as smooth as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Manage any support needs\n\n\n\nWe all know that the road to a successful event can have a few bumps along the way. That's why having a robust ticketing platform that\u2019s there for you, rain or shine, is absolutely crucial. Whether it\u2019s handling ticket refunds or various other customer service requests, it should be super easy to get those issues taken care of quickly. Thanks to TicketLeap's mobile-first ticketing platform, you can handle customers' requests on the go straight from your phone. Plus, you've got a stellar support team that's as committed to your event's success as you are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Check in attendees\n\n\n\nA great ticketing platform will give you plenty of options that make it easy for you to welcome your guests and keep your admissions lines moving quickly on event day. Attendees should be able to easily print physical tickets or download them digitally, whichever they prefer. Then, use your platform's mobile app to scan tickets quickly at the gate, or generate a printable list of guests to cross off by hand. For customers looking to buy tickets onsite, use your platform's app for box office ticket sales to seamlessly admit them into your event as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Track data from your event tickets\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to sell tickets to an event online, you can generate detailed reports that will pull the data from your ticket orders in an instant. By creating custom reports based on your sales, orders, and attendees, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your entire event.&nbsp;Smart reporting tools&nbsp;also make it easy to keep an eye out for any red flags (like large orders or duplicate accounts) to help you avoid&nbsp;chargebacks. Plus, with the right ticketing platform, you can even connect Google Analytics to track the success of your campaigns and gain visibility into social media activity to find out which platforms are most popular with your audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 11: Build an audience for your next event\n\n\n\nAfter your event wraps up, those custom reports will especially come in handy! Send&nbsp;follow-up emails&nbsp;with surveys to your attendee lists to get their feedback and evaluate responses from your registration forms to help tailor your next event. Gauge which marketing strategies brought in the most sales and which can be better optimized. You can even consider sending out&nbsp;targeted email campaigns&nbsp;to inform your attendees of upcoming events and offer discount codes for future experiences that they can share with their friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMastering how to sell tickets online\n\n\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide on how to sell tickets to an event online, and you'll be on track to pull off your best event yet!

Pop-up events are an amazing way to get people excited about your brand and drive loads of engagement! Read on to find the best tips on pop-up event planning, plus a few examples of successful ones!\n\n\n\nHow do pop-up events work?\n\n\n\nPop-up events are temporary, surprise events that are hosted in unique places! As the name suggests, these types of events \u201cpop up\u201d in unexpected places like empty lots, art galleries, hotels, or even college campuses. Not only can these types of events build lots of hype around your brand but, depending on the length of your temporary pop-up event, they are also known for maximizing your ROI! You can reap all the benefits of hosting an event, while cutting typical costs in half like venue and event staffing, since your event is only for a limited time. This type of event can work wonders in any industry and for any organization, small or large!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow long should a pop-up event be?\n\n\n\nYour pop-up event can be however long you\u2019d like! There\u2019s no right or wrong answer because it all depends on the unique needs of your event. It can be daily or a few hours for a week, or it could even last a month or more. The way you structure the dates and times of your pop-up event should be chosen based on the goals of your event and your target audience. Take Penguin Life, for example, a publishing group that decided to host a pop-up bookshop event on International Women\u2019s Day. Since their goal was to showcase titles by female writers, Penguin Life strategically chose to host it on International Women\u2019s Day to take advantage of the trend of seasonal pop-ups. They also donated their ticket sale proceeds to a women\u2019s nonprofit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips on how to plan a pop-up event\n\n\n\nEager to put on this type of event yourself? It\u2019s time to take notes! Here are a few tips on how to plan a successful pop-up event!\n\n\n\n1. Determine a clear goal\n\n\n\nA pop-up event should have a very specific goal. Think beyond ticket sales: do you want to increase brand awareness? Are you wanting to bring your community together around a shared interest? How about promoting a new campaign? These are just a few examples of the types of closely targeted goals you can aim to achieve. Determining your goals will also help you design the entire event, from how it\u2019s laid out to how you measure your success.\n\n\n\nFor instance, Paka, a company that makes sustainable clothing from alpaca wool, wanted to go offline and connect with people in real life for its brand. Since the vision was to connect with others, the founder went on tour with two alpacas and was able to build a devout following by offering free alpaca hugs. He also gave out gift cards to attendees to buy Paka\u2019s clothes in exchange for sharing their email addresses. This is a great example of how the founder\u2019s specific vision helped design the layout of their pop-up event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Select an event venue that aligns with your target audience&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYour pop-up venue should be super easy for attendees to get to! Think about where your target audience spends the most time and plan to host it in a space that\u2019ll draw in a lot of traffic from them. For instance, if you\u2019re raising awareness for the importance of healthy sleeping habits and are targeting college students, why not host your event on a college campus? This way, you\u2019ll receive a lot of foot traffic from students going to and from class.&nbsp;Your venue should also adapt to the needs of your event. If you need outlets or audio equipment ahead of time, choose a venue that\u2019s able to accommodate that. Your location sets the stage for the atmosphere you\u2019re trying to create, so they both must align. For example, we wouldn\u2019t want a selfie museum in a location that has poor lighting! The neat thing about these temporary events is that you can have multiple locations. If you have a few ideal pop-up venues in mind, consider going to the next one after your first one wraps up, so you can reach a wider audience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Consider event logistics ahead of time\n\n\n\nEven if your event doesn\u2019t run for very long, there are still accessibility regulations and permits that are necessary to host your incredible pop-up! To save you an extra step, it may be best to select a location that already complies with these guidelines like a hotel, restaurant, or art gallery. Consider all factors that\u2019ll go into your event, like where people will park, how you\u2019ll check people in, or what kind of food and beverage service you\u2019ll provide. Regarding this last piece, there may be certain rules regarding how close a food truck can be to a brick-and-mortar restaurant as well as licenses to obtain to serve alcohol. These are just a few of the event logistics that should be squared away ahead of time to prepare for a smooth event, so it\u2019s best to meet with the coordinator of your selected venue to work out all the details.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4. Collaborate with potential sponsors\n\n\n\nSince your pop-up is meant to bring people together over a shared interest, why not partner with a loved local business that\u2019s tied to what your pop-up event is all about? Select a sponsor whose audience is similar to yours so you can tap into their audience too! For example, if you\u2019re hosting a pop-up shop selling essential oils, perhaps partnering with a local yoga studio can reach the right crowd. The right partnership will help enhance your attendees\u2019 experience, foster a positive brand image online for your organization, and build trust with your audience. You\u2019ll reap benefits from having your sponsor help market your event too, driving more traffic to your pop-up!\n\n\n\n5. Use event ticketing software to create a unique event page\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re hosting an event, you\u2019ll need to get your tickets on sale! Whether your event tickets are free or for a price, using event management software makes this process so much easier! Create a unique event page fully dedicated to your event branding so your attendees can easily purchase tickets online. TicketLeap allows you to quickly design a vibrant event landing page that\u2019s as exciting as your pop-up! Our intuitive ticketing system also makes it really easy to send email campaigns to your next event or send post-event surveys to gain feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Write a compelling pop-up event description\n\n\n\nTo pair with your event page, create a compelling event description that gets your attendees hype for your event! Your pop-up event description should be exciting and generate buzz by clearly detailing the value of attending your event. We know you know why the event is awesome, so be sure to capture that in a way that tells your attendees why your in-person event is worth coming to. It should also incorporate relevant keywords about your event (e.g. the topic of your pop-up, and the location) so your attendees can easily find your event in search results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Amp up your pop-up event marketing\n\n\n\nA crucial (and super fun) piece of your event\u2019s success is your pop-up event marketing! The key to marketing your pop-up is to make quality video content consistently, that showcases the uniqueness of your pop-up event. Tapping into the power of TikTok, you could create teaser and behind-the-scenes videos to build excitement prior to the event. On top of TikTok, post stories every day on your other social media platforms too (like Instagram!) to keep the momentum going and excite more people to attend! Some effective ways to engage your audience prior to the event are by doing live streams, giveaways, or polls.\n\n\n\nAlong with your social media efforts, write a press release to the local news outlets and secure some TV spots for maximum coverage of your pop-up. The idea of pop-up events was built on out-of-the-box thinking, so apply this to your event marketing! For instance, think about what you can include in your event to promote User Generated Content (UGC)! UGC from attendees at your pop-up is super valuable for the exposure of your event to wider audiences. Perhaps you include an aesthetic photo-booth and encourage attendees to snap a selfie and share on their social media using a dedicated hashtag for your event. Spice things up by hosting a social media give away for a lucky attendee who posts and uses your hashtag! This way your event-goers are incentivized to share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Keep the conversation going with event swag&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe excitement doesn\u2019t have to end once your pop-up is gone. Go the extra mile by handing out event swag during and at the end of your event. This way, you build brand recognition while also staying top of mind to your attendees long after you\u2019ve left! And don\u2019t forget to send a post-event thank you email to show your appreciation to those who supported your pop-up! You can even send exclusive details about your future pop-up to those who attended this one to get the hype started early.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow do you measure the success of a pop-up event?\n\n\n\nTo measure the success of a pop-up event, you need to take a look at your event\u2019s goals. Were you able to achieve the amount of ticket sales you\u2019d hoped? Did you meet your hyper-targeted goal? For instance, if your goal is to sell a product, then you may want to look at foot traffic to conversions. This means taking a look at how many people who physically visited your pop-up purchased a product. Similarly, if your goal was to build your email list for an upcoming campaign, then your event success can be measured by how many emails you were able to collect.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinal words\n\n\n\nWell would you look at that, you just learned how to plan a pop-up event! In order to host a successful pop-up event, you\u2019ll need to set targeted goals and plan out every detail to achieve them. Square away event logistics, marketing, and partnerships ahead of time to help you put out the most successful pop-up event you can. And consider working with ticketing software like TicketLeap to set up your awesome event page and get assistance from their friendly support team every step of the way!\n","date":"18 Apr 2024","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/AdobeStock_525985495-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

But how do you know if your event was truly successful? As an important tool for measuring event success, a post-event survey allows you to gather valuable thoughts, opinions, and suggestions from your attendees while your event is still fresh on their minds. By asking the right questions in your post-event survey, collecting this meaningful data will allow you to improve your current event as well as make future ones even better. In this article, we've compiled a list of 15+ post-event survey questions that you can use to gather valuable feedback to help improve your next event. \n\n\n\nWhy post-event surveys are important\n\n\n\nGathering valuable feedback directly from your attendees (aka, zero-party data) is a game-changer for any event planner. It provides you with actionable insights straight from your fans that are crucial for improving future events. You'll know exactly what worked and what didn\u2019t \u2014 be it guest speakers, sessions, specific haunted attractions, or some other aspect of your event. This clarity means no more guessing games; you'll have a clear roadmap of what your audience loves about your events, and how you can build bigger and better events. \n\n\n\nMoreover, acting upon these post-event surveys will make your current event attendees feel heard and valued. This strengthens their connection to your events, making them more likely to return in the future, and builds a firm foundation of trust. By understanding which channels brought in the most attendees, you can hone your future event planning and marketing strategies to be more effective and efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices for your post-event survey questions\n\n\n\nAs you build out your post-event survey, here's the lowdown of some important tips to keep in mind to make it the best possible source of attendee feedback!\n\n\n\n\nKeep it short! It's best to keep your post-event survey short and sweet so it takes only 3-5 minutes maximum to complete. Good rule of thumb: the quicker the survey, the more event attendees will fill it out. This typically would end up being between 5-10 questions.\n\n\n\nShow how you're tailoring future events to their feedback! Tell people how past feedback has impacted your current attendee experience and made it better \u2013 it'll motivate them to share their feedback this time too.\n\n\n\nEncourage people to be honest! Negative feedback is just as valuable and constructive as positive comments, as this gives you candid insight on areas for improvement and shows you truly value your attendees' opinions.\n\n\n\nSweeten the deal! Consider offering a perk as a little thank you for responding to your post-event survey, like discounts on future tickets or a chance to win gift cards, free tickets, or something else really cool in a raffle. You\u2019ll want to be careful with this though, since incentives can also potentially dilute the quality of your survey results, since some may just complete your form for the sake of the reward and not for giving honest feedback.\n\n\n\nKeep things flexible! While you should require answers to your most important questions (especially ones that are easier to answer, like multiple choice), it's best that not every question is a must-answer. Mix up optional and required questions, leaving the more in-depth long answer questions optional for anyone with additional thoughts to share.\n\n\n\nGive a gentle nudge! If someone doesn\u2019t answer your survey, feel free to follow up one or twice over the next two weeks after your event. Let them know how much you value their thoughts to help improve next year's event.\n\n\n\nBe prepared! Create your post-event survey questions well before your event ends, so that once it does, your survey will be ready to go to send to attendees!\n\n\n\n\nNeed help getting started on your post-event survey? We've got a free template for you to check out and use below!\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Our Free Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of questions for post-event surveys\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo gather your data as accurately as possible, there's a variety of event survey questions you can use to collect feedback from your attendees. Some will provide you with more qualitative data while others will be more quantitative in nature. It just depends on the types of attendee feedback you'll need for your upcoming events.\n\n\n\n1. Multiple choice questions\n\n\n\nWhen designing multiple choice questions for an event survey, it's common to use closed-ended options such as \"yes\" and \"no\", \"true\" and \"false\", or a list of simple phrases related to your question topic. These questions are especially popular because of how straightforward they are, allowing for quick responses from your participants. For more nuanced answers not captured in your list of answers, it's a good practice to include an open field or an \"Other\" option. This addition ensures that while you benefit from the structured format of closed-ended questions, you still get every inch of the valuable feedback you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Matrix questions\n\n\n\nUtilizing matrix questions in a post-event survey is an efficient way to collect feedback on a number of questions at once. By presenting multiple statements or questions within a single table, respondents can easily provide their answers across a numerical scale (e.g., levels of satisfaction). This not only makes it easy for previous attendees to provide feedback on multiple areas in rapid fire, but it makes comparing the data across each event survey question easier for the event organizer to analyze later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Rating scales\n\n\n\nThese questions help turn opinions into numbers, allowing you to gather quantitative data to best gauge attendee satisfaction. You'll want to provide context to the numbers on your scale's spectrum, such as \"very likely\" to \"very unlikely\". The most common of these is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which asks attendees how likely they are to recommend your event to a friend on a scale from 1-10. On the NPS scale specifically, you can calculate your final NPS score by calculating your percentage of promoters (the 9-10 range) minus the percentage of the detractors (6 and below). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Likert scales\n\n\n\nBy using a likert scale, participants can indicate how much they agree or disagree with a statement to help organizers gauge the overall sentiment. As a more specific type of rating scale, likert scales typically use a scale of 5 or 7 for a more nuanced view of participants' experiences. Whether it's assessing the satisfaction with the event's content, the venue, or the overall experience, likert scale questions help ensure that future events are even more successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Dropdown questions\n\n\n\nDropdown questions provide a group of fields for event attendees to select from for their answer. This makes it super straightforward for respondents to select from a comprehensive list of options, making it easy to gather insights about your target audience. Instead of using a multiple-choice question with a ton of answers to pick from, dropdown questions offer a more consolidated approach, allowing for an extensive range of answers without overwhelming the participant. This could include asking questions about their demographics (like age range), their favorite speaker, or what their preferred social media platform is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Open ended question\n\n\n\nThis question type is most effective in uncovering feedback you might otherwise not have discovered. Unlike the other question types above that are quantitative in nature, these open-ended questions (either short or long answer) gather qualitative data. Your attendees can share any positive or negative sentiments in their own words that they wouldn't have otherwise been able to share in your other questions. These questions take longer to answer, so it's best to keep them optional in your survey so people have an outlet to share their thoughts if they want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of post-event survey questions\n\n\n\nCongrats! Now that you know the types of post-event survey questions you can choose from, let's figure out the questions you'll ask! To help brainstorm, here are some examples of questions for three different audiences: your attendees, event sponsors, and your staff. \n\n\n\nQuestions for your attendees\n\n\n\n1. How did you hear about our events?\n\n\n\nHear firsthand from attendees on what marketing channels are bringing them in, whether it's your social media posts, your emails, word of mouth, etc.\n\n\n\n2. Was the event structured well?\n\n\n\nThis is likely a rating-style or open-ended question, one that's fitting especially for corporate events, conventions, and events with a number of sessions.\n\n\n\n3. How would you rate the location?\n\n\n\nThese quick assessments of various aspects of your event are perfect to incorporate in a matrix-style survey question. You could ask them to rate other aspects on a numerical scale too, such as the parking, public transit options, and more.\n\n\n\n4. How likely are you to attend next year's event?\n\n\n\nSuccessful events keep people coming back for more, so this will help gauge if your annual event met that goal! Using these responses can help you with forecasting your event growth as well.\n\n\n\n5. How likely are you to attend other events of ours?\n\n\n\nThis will help you gauge if people are interested in attending future events (you could even give a few examples) beyond just the one they attended.\n\n\n\n6. How likely are you to recommend this event to a friend or family member?\n\n\n\nRemember that Net Promoter Score? This question helps event organizers determine how many of their attendees will promote your event to others and likely they'll attend future events with their friends!\n\n\n\n7. What was your favorite moment at our event?\n\n\n\nThis open-ended question gives your attendees the space to share specific positive stories about your event. With their consent, this is a perfect opportunity to gather testimonials to feature on your event website and future ticketing pages as well!\n\n\n\n8. Was the signup process for our event easy? \n\n\n\nDetermine how smooth the ticket purchase process was to identify any hold ups that might have prevented others from buying their tickets. This could be particularly insightful if your attendance numbers were less than expected.\n\n\n\n9. How could we have improved your experience?\n\n\n\nThis is powerful for gathering feedback on how to improve future events! Leave this as an open-ended question to allow attendees to voice their opinions candidly to help your next event.\n\n\n\n10. Have you attended our events before?\n\n\n\nDiscover how many of your attendees are regulars! You could even ask for them to give an estimated number of events they've been to before to further gauge their loyalty.\n\n\n\n11. What topics do you hope to see more of at future events?\n\n\n\nAsking this allows you to hear what sessions or activities were best, straight from attendees. Depending on your event type, you could also ask different forms of this question, like asking about their favorite performers, attractions, and more.\n\n\n\n12. Did the event meet your expectations?\n\n\n\nEnsure your attendees can share their constructive feedback here with this open-ended question. That way, you can take any deficits that might have arisen and address them in your future event planning.\n\n\n\n13. Demographic-specific questions about education, age, location, etc.\n\n\n\nAsking your attendees to share a bit about themselves, whether that be their age range, where they're from, or how many people are in their family, can help you gather important information to better understand your target audience and better tailor your experiences to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for your event staff and volunteers\n\n\n\n1. Would you consider our event successful? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nAsk your event staff for their honest thoughts! As key players in your event's success, their insight on what works well and what didn't will be essential for improving future events.\n\n\n\n2. How can we improve our event operations in the future?\n\n\n\nThis is a great opportunity for your event staff to share any suggestions for your future events, like a change in location, selected speakers, or improvements to team communication.\n\n\n\n3. Did you feel prepared to assist with the event?\n\n\n\nEspecially important for your volunteers or new staff members, make sure that your team feels properly trained to help run a successful event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for your sponsors\n\n\n\n1. Did you get all the information you needed before the event?\n\n\n\nThese types of follow up questions allow you to best streamline your event operations, so it's a pleasant experience not just for attendees, but for your sponsors too.\n\n\n\n2. How can we improve your event experience in the future?\n\n\n\nThis shows your event sponsors how much you care about them and can use this constructive feedback form your post-event survey to encourage and enhance their future sponsorships at your next event.\n\n\n\n3. Did you have ample networking opportunities at our event?\n\n\n\nSponsors are looking for chances to build their network and make connections, whether with attendees or fellow vendors at your event. Asking about this ensures they feel heard and got the opportunities they were looking for.\n\n\n\n(Bonus!) Pre-event survey questions\n\n\n\nA pre-event survey can help you improve future events as well as this one! Here's a few questions you could include in a pre-event survey to help plan your next event before it happens. Within TicketLeap's suite of features, you can also embed some of these questions in your checkout process as event attendees buy their tickets! Here are some pre-event question ideas to help you get the ball rolling.\n\n\n\n1. Are there any special accommodations we should be aware of?\n\n\n\nAsking this shows that you value inclusivity at your events. This will allow you to prepare in advance for any accessibility concerns for attendees that may need it.\n\n\n\n2. Do you have any food allergies?\n\n\n\nIf you are serving food at your event, this is a critical question to ask, ensuring that any attendees with dietary restrictions are able to enjoy eating at your event worry-free.\n\n\n\n3. How did you hear about our event?\n\n\n\nDetermine which marketing channels (email, social media, TV, etc.) are bringing in your upcoming attendees, so you can hone in on those more popular channels in the remaining weeks leading up to your event.\n\n\n\n4. What are you most excited for at our event?\n\n\n\nThis question will allow you to gauge which sessions, guest speakers, performers, etc. will likely be the most popular once your event day arrives.\n\n\n\n5. Have you attended this event in the past?\n\n\n\nFrom the get-go, this helps give you a better idea of who's a returning attendee versus who's coming for the first time, so you can better tailor their event day experience.\n\n\n\n6. What's your favorite social media platform?\n\n\n\nUse this question to determine which social media platforms to focus on in your event marketing efforts, so you can maximize your event\u2019s reach.\n\n\n\nWays to collect post-event feedback&nbsp;for future events\n\n\n\nWhile tons of platforms exist to host your post-event survey, here are some starting places of survey platforms to use for measuring attendee satisfaction.\n\n\n\nSurvey Monkey\n\n\n\nSurvey Monkey is a powerful virtual platform with tons of survey question types, over 250+ customizable templates, and even AI tools to help build your post-event surveys with maximum efficiency.\n\n\n\nGoogle Forms\n\n\n\nAs a part of Google's suite of solutions, Google Forms is a straightforward (and totally free!) way to create a simple yet dynamic form to gather your post-event survey data.\n\n\n\nTypeform\n\n\n\nPerfect for gathering your event feedback to improve future planning efforts, Typeform makes it easy for you to build beautifully branded post-event surveys&nbsp;with all the question types you need.\n\n\n\nJotform\n\n\n\nYou can build powerful event surveys with Jotform, complete with automated workflows, dynamic reporting for planning future events, and more to save time for your event organization.\n\n\n\nSurveyPlanet\n\n\n\nSurveyPlanet allows you to easily create free surveys with unlimited numbers of questions and responses, custom branding, pre-written templates, and more.\n\n\n\nHow to best share your post-event survey questions\n\n\n\nOnce you've made your form, you're probably wondering when and where to best post your follow up questions? Ideally, you'll want to get your survey out there within the first day or two after your event, while your successful event is fresh on people's minds! As a strong option, you could send a post-event follow-up email with a call-to-action button directing people to your survey. Luckily, with TicketLeap, you can send this survey email directly from your ticketing platform to help streamline your event marketing efforts. \n\n\n\nYou can also post a QR code of your survey's link onsite for attendees to see in person as they leave your event. To encourage more responses, feel free to sweeten the deal with an incentive like adding their name to a raffle or earning a ticket discount on your next event. Sharing the survey on your website or social media could also be a good idea, though keep in mind that you may risk receiving feedback from people who weren't actual attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant note: whenever asking for feedback, ensure you get their consent before sharing it! This is especially important for any glowing feedback you got in your long-answer questions that you'd like to feature as a testimonial on your event website. To do this, you could add a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" question asking for their consent at the bottom of your survey.\n\n\n\nA few last words\n\n\n\nUltimately, creating a comprehensive list of survey questions for event feedback is essential for any event organizer wanting to improve their future events. By carefully selecting a mix of question types and using our best practices to guide you, you can gather powerful metrics to better understand what worked well and what could use improvement for future events. Remember, the goal is not just to measure your event's success but build stronger connections with your attendees, making them feel valued and heard.

Lucky for you, with our team's extensive research, we\u2019ve solved the mystery! Read on to learn tips on how to craft compelling event subject lines and equip yourself with 45 ideas to test out for your next event email.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy event email subject lines are so important\n\n\n\nEvent email subject lines are your first impression to potential attendees. It\u2019s the deciding factor on whether or not your recipient opens your email to read more and ultimately buy their tickets to your upcoming event. This is why you must get it right! It\u2019s been said that 47% of recipients will open an email based on your subject line, while 69% of recipients will report spam based on the subject line. This statistic shows just how important this element is in making or breaking your email. But fear not! We have tips and tricks for your subject lines that can boost your event email open rate!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow your audience&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo start writing the perfect email, you\u2019ve got to know exactly who you\u2019re writing to! By now in your event planning process, you should have a good read on who your target audience is with the help of your surveys, custom questions at checkout, follower demographics on social media, and more. This is super important because understanding what resonates with your audience is key to crafting an event subject line that will stand out in their inbox and actually get clicked. Assess your attendee demographics and research what kinds of content they consume. Are they a younger generation who appeals to a more friendly, fun tone of voice? Or are they industry professionals who\u2019d resonate with a more business-casual tone in your writing? These are just a few examples of how knowing your audience can reflect in your choice of writing style. The more you tailor your message to resonate with your attendees, the more likely they are to open your email!\n\n\n\n5 tips on writing catchy email subject lines\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into our curated list of event subject line examples, let\u2019s go over a few general tips that you can apply when creating your subject line.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Keep it short&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe know you want to delve into your event details so your recipient knows exactly why it\u2019s a must-attend event, but don\u2019t jump too far ahead! Keep your subject line short and sweet, ideally between 7-9 words or about 60 characters. This way, mobile users can read the full line without anything being cut off. You'll pack a punch, leaving your reader wanting to open for more! Your subject line should give enough information so your recipient knows what the email is about without being too lengthy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Avoid spam words\n\n\n\nOne of the best things you can do as you put together your event email campaign is to research how to avoid email spam filters. A spam filter is designed to keep unwanted or dangerous emails out of a recipient's inbox, and we need to make sure your event invitation email doesn\u2019t get mistaken for one! There are many types of spam trigger words to be aware of like \u201c100% Free\u201d or \u201cAct Now\u201d. This is because they are either exaggerated promises or pushing a questionable sense of urgency. To work around this if you\u2019re still looking to create a sense of urgency, try using a phrase like \u201cLimited Time Offer\u201d instead of \u201cAct Now\u201d. As long as you remain responsible with these words, you\u2019ll be just fine! If you\u2019re unsure whether your subject line is up to par, check out a subject line tester. This will let you know if your subject line is an optimal length and help you avoid using any negative words.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Stir the emotions with your subject lines\n\n\n\nWhat emotion do you want to evoke in your recipient? Perhaps a fear of missing out? How about excitement? According to Zippia, emotional content is 94% more effective than rational content. Rather than just stating that your event is coming up, briefly capture how awesome the experience is going to be with some powerful adjectives to pique readers\u2019 interest. You could also mention phrases like \u201cTickets Are Selling Fast!\u201d in your subject line to get your potential attendees in on the action before your event sells out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Utilize emojis and numbers\n\n\n\nEmojis are a super fun and powerful way to level up your event subject line! In fact, 56% of brands that utilize emojis in their subject lines have higher open rates! Be sure to use them sparingly (finding the one perfect emoji is the way to go!) and not give an emoji overload. Similarly, try incorporating a number in your subject. This could be anything from an event statistic like how many people attended your last event to another metric you\u2019re proud to show off like the number of special guests in your conference lineup or the amount your nonprofit has fundraised already.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Implement A\/B testing&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you really want to see which subject lines work, try using A\/B testing. This is a sure way to gain insight into what types of subject lines lead to higher open rates with your audience. To conduct an A\/B test, you create two subject lines and deliver one line to a portion of your email list while sending the other line to the rest. Tools like Constant Contact offer A\/B testing so you can be more intentional to use subject lines that lead to higher open rates. This works for post-event thank-you emails as well, in case you want to find the best subject lines for trying to collect feedback after your event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 ideas for event email subject lines\n\n\n\nTime for the star of the show!

Now it\u2019s time for the fun part: creating a great event landing page and getting those tickets live and ready to sell. Your customers\u2019 first impression of your event page can make or break their decision to follow through with their purchase, so you want to take extra care to build it the right way. What makes for the perfect event page design, you might be wondering? We\u2019re glad you asked! As you build your page on TicketLeap and get more eyes on your event listing, follow these tips and check out our event landing page examples to help you sell more tickets.\n\n\n\nHow do I create an event landing page?\n\n\n\nIt's easy! Simply sign up for a TicketLeap account, give us your basic event information, and you're ready for lift off. Once you have logged into your account, click on the \"Create Event\" button and fill in all your important event details such as its name, event date, start and end times, and location. You can add in venues or pull a saved location from previous events on your page. Be sure to add a few types of event categories too so potential attendees in your target audience are able to more easily find it. Add your event's capacity and select from various ticket types (free, paid, and pay-what-you-want) to further build out your unique landing page. From there, it's a matter of inserting all your key details and encouraging visitors to buy their tickets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes good event landing pages?\n\n\n\nOnce you've got all the essential elements added in, now it's time to flesh everything out with our helpful tips for creating a successful event landing page!\n\n\n\n1. Use attention-grabbing images &amp; videos\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the first thing that immediately captures visitors' attention on your event page? Your header image! Use this space as an opportunity to give a snapshot into your event. The more exciting the image, the more interested your audience will be (and more likely to purchase tickets). Showcase attendees having a blast at a past event, a notable guest sharing a laugh with the audience, or a branded graphic that showcases your lineup of performances and activities. Plus, on top of your main image, TicketLeap makes it easy to add other photos alongside your event description, so you can show off a highlight reel of everything you have to offer. You can also embed videos to truly showcase your events and persuade more potential attendees to buy their tickets. And remember, make sure all your images are high resolution \u2013 the clearer, the better. By doing some simple editing, using a tripod, and testing different camera angles, you can really bolster your event photography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Put your description to good use\n\n\n\nThis is the heart of your event listing, so make it count! Lead with a hook to get customers interested and highlight the most interesting key details of your event. Include what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re doing it, and what your attendees will get out of it. Your event description should be the place where you're educating potential customers on what they're going to get from you and convincing them they need to see it for themselves! To make the biggest impact, discuss only the most exciting aspects of your festivities. Use the dynamic formatting like headers, bulleted lists, bold text, and italics to create event landing pages that are easy to catch all your key event details at a glance. You could even add in some testimonials from previous event attendees or a brief bio to build social proof. If someone\u2019s on your page, they\u2019re already interested in what you have to offer, so give them the highlights and then stand back to let them buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Level up your event page with more features\n\n\n\nTo build the best event landing page possible, you need to make the most of all the features TicketLeap has to offer. For example, if you\u2019re hosting multiple dates at your event, showcase all your dates at once with an event calendar directly on your listing. Offer multiple ticket types (general admission, VIP, senior discount, etc.) for a single event to cater to multiple audiences and bring in more money. At checkout, include a questionnaire to gain more insights on your attendees or a waiver for your event attendees to sign (this is especially if you're hosting a haunted attraction!). Finally, add your finishing touches to match your branding on your page's background, your call to action buttons, and more. You should even consider selling add-ons like exclusive merchandise and parking passes, to pad your bottom line and give your attendees an even better event experience.\n\n\n\n4. Double up for mobile\n\n\n\nDid you know that over 60% of the traffic to your event page is likely from a mobile device? If most of your audience is visiting your event listing from their phones, it\u2019s vital that your page looks great on any mobile or desktop device. TicketLeap has already done all the heavy lifting for you to make sure your ticketing page is mobile-friendly, so all you need to do is double check that you like how your images are cropped and how your event description is formatted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Make it easy to contact you\n\n\n\nSometimes, your more curious potential buyers will need a few more details before sealing the deal. In these cases, make it as easy as possible for them to talk to your team directly and get quick answers. Including an email address on your TicketLeap event listing shows that you\u2019re willing to go the extra mile for them. You should also include links to your social media accounts within your landing page so they can check out even more of your event and stay up-to-date as your event gets closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Share, share, share!\n\n\n\nThe best way to get people onto your event landing page is with eye-catching marketing campaigns that stop them in their tracks. That means sharing your TicketLeap event listing everywhere \u2013 in your social media bios, on your event\u2019s website, on social posts, in emails, as QR codes on flyers, and anywhere else you can think of! With TicketLeap, you'll already have a QR code automatically generated for you to help raise event awareness. On top of being where you sell tickets, think of this as a landing page for event promotion as well! As people start talking more about your event and recommending it to their friends, your listing will be ready and easy for them to share, getting more people excited about your event and eager to buy tickets.\n\n\n\nAdditional event landing page examples\n\n\n\nTo help you get the ball rolling, here's a few event landing page examples to help you in your event planning!\n\n\n\nExample 1: Music event\n\n\n\nThis dedicated event landing page is a great example of capturing all the details of what to expect from your upcoming event and encouraging visitors to get their tickets! It's welcoming and to the point, with a sleek and well branded event page design that drives people to your call to action button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Theater company\n\n\n\nThis event landing page uses an embedded video to really capture people's attention, incorporates a testimonial in bold text to add social proof, and lays out all the important event details for potential attendees without getting too in the weeds. The branding of this page perfectly matches the spooky tone of this event as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Art workshop\n\n\n\nThis meticulously crafted landing page uses a vibrant photo to really make the page pop! As an event marketer, you want your pages to be drawn in from first glance not just in what you say, but in how it looks. This web page also lays out all of the details in an easy-to-scan way by using headers, bullet points, and even some emojis!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\n\nNow, it's time to build your own event landing page! With TicketLeap by your side, you\u2019ll be fully equipped to build the best event landing page possible for all your upcoming events. Now, let your creative juices flow as you master the art of crafting a high converting event landing page, then watch those ticket sales roll in!\n","date":"22 Mar 2024","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/concert-packed-with-people-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":86,"name":"Event Listing","slug":"event-listing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":86,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Building a captivating website and ticketing page are essential to selling more tickets to your events!

Now, as you think about buying your tickets, make sure to purchase from the event's official ticketing provider if at all possible. However, in certain instances, you may want to buy resale tickets. If that's the case, you'll want to take extra precaution to avoid the risk of ticket scams. Check out our tips on how to not get scammed buying tickets!\n\n\n\nWhat are ticket scams?\n\n\n\nTicket scams are unfortunately prevalent in today's world. According to the&nbsp;Better Business Bureau, thousands of unsuspecting individuals fall victim to these fraudulent schemes each year. Ticket scams involve dishonest individuals or organizations selling counterfeit or invalid tickets to unsuspecting buyers. Targeting tickets that are in high demand or are sold out, these scams are especially popular with events such as concerts, sports games, and plays. Fraudsters see a demand for tickets (like at a sold-out show) and entice people with a chance to finally go to the event. Due to their prevalence, it's all the more important that you take steps to avoid this fraud, with a trusted ticketing platform like TicketLeap by your side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do ticket scams work?\n\n\n\nOver the years, there have been different types of scams, from fake concert ticket scams to illegal resales. To help you know how to avoid ticket scams, it's important to identify ways that these schemes are typically carried out:\n\n\n\n\nFake tickets:&nbsp;Fraudsters will sell counterfeit tickets, either printed or digital, that are made to look exactly like the event's tickets but won't work when scanned.\n\n\n\nWrong seats: You'll be charged for a seat that the fraudster hasn't secured yet, then buy a cheaper seat for you after they've been paid and take the extra profit.\n\n\n\nDuplicate tickets: The same ticket will be sold to multiple people, so the first person to scan the ticket will be admitted while the others will unfortunately be turned away.\n\n\n\nSocial media scams:&nbsp;Phishing accounts will either reach out to sell you fake tickets on social media, or they'll create fake social media ads that link to fraudulent sites that sell invalid tickets.\n\n\n\nFake event website:&nbsp;On a fraudulent site, an error message will pop up after your purchase asking for you to submit your bank information again, thus charging you twice. A fraudster may also make a website similar to the event in order to capture login information and use that to steal that person's ticket purchase(s) from the actual site.\n\n\n\nIllegal resale:&nbsp;Fraudsters will use a stolen credit card to purchase tickets and then resell them for profit.\n\n\n\n\nHow to safeguard from ticket scams\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to avoiding ticket scams, your best line of defense is you! Here are some key steps on how to not get scammed buying tickets:\n\n\n\nResearch the event\n\n\n\nYour first resort should always be to go straight to the event itself to buy your tickets. That said, you'll want to do some extra investigating to determine if the event is reputable and if they're selling tickets through a secure ticketing platform. Check out third-party sites (like social media and news articles) and read reviews to find out what past attendees have said about the event.\n\n\n\nIf you're considering purchasing resale tickets, ask yourself, \u201cDoes this event explicitly say they allow ticket reselling or not?\u201d Check the event's website regarding their policy on this, or reach out to them directly to clarify. You may also want to see if people have successfully bought resold tickets there before. If the event doesn't allow ticket resale, you know to only buy tickets from the event itself!\n\n\n\nPurchase through official box offices and promoters only\n\n\n\nThe best way to avoid ticket scams is to purchase your tickets directly from the source (aka, the event!). Whether you buy directly on their website or through a third-party event listing, check that they're using a secure, reputable ticketing platform \u2013 like&nbsp;TicketLeap! If you want to be extra sure, you can contact TicketLeap's&nbsp;support team&nbsp;to confirm before purchasing your tickets.\n\n\n\nIf you search the event online, don't assume the first few sites in the search results are legitimate. There's a chance they're not the official website and could sell fake tickets. Therefore,&nbsp;always triple check that you're purchasing through the event's official website and their verified ticketing provider. Not only will you ensure your tickets are valid, you'll also get the best prices that way too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to safely buy resale tickets from a third-party vendor\n\n\n\nShould you need to\u00a0purchase resale tickets, the safest way is through verified ticket resellers. When doing so, stick to brands you trust like\u00a0SeatGeek\u00a0or\u00a0StubHub. However, an important disclaimer with resale tickets, there's always an outside chance they're not authentic tickets, so always prioritize buying from the official source. That said, here's a few factors to help confirm that you're purchasing from a legit third-party vendor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck seller reviews\n\n\n\nTo safeguard from unauthorized third-party sellers, don't automatically trust the links that appear in search results. Though being at the top of search results may make them seem trustworthy, these links could be fraudulent like fake paid ads or tickets being sold with super high fees. So, take caution and do some extra digging \u2013 it's worth it!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVerify the legitimacy of the seller by checking their reviews online. Pay close attention to any reviews with negative terms in them such as \u201cfake\u201d, \u201cfraud\u201d, or \u201cscam\u201d (both related to this event if available and others on the resellers' site). As for how to verify tickets are real, you should confirm the vendor's contact information (phone number, email address, etc.) as well as look for security features such as a secure checkout system and customer service policies. Check what the prices typically are too. Avoid tickets with major discounts compared to their normal prices directly from the event.\" Ultimately, your vigilance will help protect you from potential scams so you can buy your tickets with confidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriple-check the time and location of your tickets\n\n\n\nEven if the seller is legitimate, it can be easy to buy tickets for the wrong time and location \u2013 so, be careful! People often buy the incorrect dates or cities of resellers because it isn't 100% clear. So when purchasing tickets, make sure to double-check the dates, times, and locations of your tickets before you click \u201cbuy\u201d.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead ticket guarantees and refund policies\n\n\n\nTo confidently buy resale tickets, use a reseller that has a crystal clear refund policy. In their refund policy, ensure there's a clear and explicit statement that you'll receive valid tickets or you'll get your money back. In case the unexpected happens, confirm what the reseller's policy is regarding event cancellations or rescheduling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnly purchase through verified resellers with a credit card\n\n\n\nWhen making purchases, it's highly recommended to use a verified seller and avoid peer-to-peer payment methods like Zelle, Cash App, and Venmo. What are verified resale tickets exactly? They are the safest way to buy tickets outside of the event's ticketing provider. To protect yourself when buying tickets, research what third-party resellers the event's ticketing platform endorses. You can also refer to additional resources like the members of the&nbsp;National Association of Ticket Brokers&nbsp;(NATB), associated with the Better Business Bureau.\n\n\n\nIf you do use a peer-to-peer payment service (like purchasing tickets from a mutual friend), be sure to utilize purchase protection services like PayPal Goods and Services. Moreover, it's advised to&nbsp;always&nbsp;use a credit card for an extra layer of safety. That way, in the instance where it is fraud, you can dispute the charge with your credit card company and keep your bank account protected. Remember, it's absolutely vital to be 100% sure the tickets are real before buying them!\n\n\n\nLooking to buy from a person? How to avoid ticket scammers\n\n\n\nWe strongly recommend people prioritize purchasing tickets directly from the event's official website, then looking into verified ticket resale platforms if tickets are no longer available on the website. Buying from individuals should be one's last resort, and only done with people you trust. That said, here are some tips on how to not get scammed buying tickets, including red flags to look out for.\n\n\n\nStick to people you know\n\n\n\nShould you choose to buy from an individual, it's best to stick with people you know personally - like mutual friends or coworkers. Even in these instances though, ask to see the tickets before buying them, so you can verify they're real tickets and that they didn't accidentally purchase invalid tickets from a reseller.\n\n\n\nDouble-check ticket details\n\n\n\nCurious how to tell if tickets are fake? To start off, ask for the ticket purchaser to send you their original ticket purchase confirmation via email or in person. It's important to receive this receipt via email so they don't create a fake one and you can verify that the email address from the vendor (like StubHub or Ticketmaster) is legit. Fake \u201cFrom\u201d emails (like help-ticketmaster.com or ticket-master.com) are a clear sign of fake tickets. Fraudulent tickets could be for seats that don't exist in the venue. If you're unsure, feel free to call the venue itself to confirm. If you meet in person to see the tickets, ensure you meet in a public place with lots of people around.\n\n\n\nEven if the resold ticket looks legitimate, someone may have replicated it, which means purchasing through a third party cannot be 100% verified. The only foolproof way to know if tickets are authentic is to purchase them directly through the event's ticketing provider or their box office yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware of too-good-to-be-true deals\n\n\n\nIf a seller is pressuring you to make a quick purchase, that's a huge red flag. Take your time and trust your instincts. Remember, if someone approaches&nbsp;you&nbsp;about their tickets, it's likely a fraud attempt. Do your research on what the ticket price is, because if these tickets are overpriced or heavily discounted, it could be a sign that they're not legitimate.\n\n\n\nSpot suspicious payment methods\n\n\n\nWhen paying for tickets,&nbsp;never&nbsp;wire the money or purchase with a prepaid money card. If you do use a peer-to-peer payment processor, use a purchase protection policy, ensuring you're eligible for a refund if the tickets are fake. By sticking to these precautions, you can shield yourself from fraudulent ticket sales and enjoy your event!\n\n\n\nLook out for online marketplaces and social media\n\n\n\nBe wary of online marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. To verify the seller, you'll need to do some digging on their profile to ensure they're an actual person and not impersonating a fan or using a hacked account. Some telltale signs of illegitimate sellers are a super low follower count and generic images on their account.\n\n\n\nAs we mentioned previously, another way people can try to scam you is through fake event ads. If you see a social media ad for an awesome event, pull up the event's website in your browser to avoid the risk of clicking into a fake ad. This simple step can help you navigate how to avoid ticket scams!\n\n\n\nAlready bought a fake ticket? Here's what to do\n\n\n\nShould you discover that you've purchased a fraudulent ticket, contact your bank and your credit card company immediately. By reporting the ticket fraud to your credit card company, they'll help&nbsp;dispute the charge&nbsp;(if not stop it altogether!). It's also important to file a local police report, especially if you had any in-person interaction with the scammer. Additionally, reach out to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding the incident, and consider sharing your experience on the Better Business Bureau Scam Tracker to help others avoid similar ticket scams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it! When it comes to buying tickets, it's important to know how to verify tickets are real to ensure everything goes smoothly on event day. Remember to always purchase through the actual event and their official ticket provider (like TicketLeap!), and avoid third-party vendors unless absolutely necessary. Should you purchase resale tickets, exercise extreme caution with the help of these tips.

Now, it's time to send a thoughtful post-event email that shares your gratitude to each attendee. However, considering the average person receives over 100 emails per day, it's important to ensure that the thank-you message after attending your event stands out from the crowd. Here's how to craft an irresistible email that'll make your attendees feel super appreciated!\n\n\n\nWhy a post-event thank-you email matters\n\n\n\nYour attendees took the time to come out to your event and had a memorable time with their friends and family in the process. A heartfelt thank-you email after your event not only shows your genuine appreciation but also reiterates how valuable it was for them to attend in the first place. It builds their trust, thus making them excited to come back to your next one! When done right, these emails are vital to your&nbsp;event marketing strategy&nbsp;because of how they help retain existing attendees. Plus, add a survey to this email, and you'll be able to gain valuable feedback on how you can improve your future events!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey elements to include in your post-event thank-you email\n\n\n\nEager to spread the love? Let's dive into the essential elements that make up effective event follow-up emails.\n\n\n\n1. Subject line\n\n\n\nYour subject line is your first impression \u2013 so make it count! To start, keep it concise and compelling at around 9 words or 60 characters. Remember, the goal of a clear subject line is to grab your recipient's attention and make them eager to open your email.\n\n\n\nConsider adding emojis for an extra touch of excitement and warmth. Don't shy away from question marks or exclamation marks as they can convey enthusiasm or peak curiosity. And if you want to spice things up, think about incentivizing your readers with a sneak peek or exclusive offer if they fill out your post-event survey. Here's a few examples of some email subject lines:\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Want a Free Ticket to Our Next Event? (Fill Out Our Survey!)\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Cheers to Harmony Fest! \ud83c\udfb6 Thanks for the Magic!\"\n\n\n\n\"Kudos from CharityRun! \ud83c\udf1f Your Presence Shined Bright!\"\n\n\n\n\" \ud83c\udf20 We're Grateful for Your Support at Unity Gala!\"\n\n\n\n\"Epic Moments at DreamQuest! \ud83d\ude80 Thank You, Trailblazers!\"\n\n\n\n\n2. Personalized greeting\n\n\n\nA personalized greeting is powerful! Addressing recipients by their name, referring to the specific event they attended, or even acknowledging their continuous support (if they're regular event attendees), all make your event-goers feel seen and valued. A good example of this could be \"John, Thanks for Helping Make Our Event a Success!\" or \"Thank You for Making Our Fall Event Unforgettable, Sarah!\"\n\n\n\n3. Email body\n\n\n\nThis is the bulk of your email where you'll want to go into more detail to fully express your gratitude. To help get you started, we've included a few more important pieces you may want to mix and match in your email's body paragraphs.\n\n\n\nShowing gratitude&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExpress your thanks sincerely, acknowledging their contribution to the event's success. Opt for a genuine, heartfelt tone and go into detail about the ways that people helped make this event an unforgettable one. Sharing specific stories or examples could go a long way towards truly capturing how much you appreciate your attendees.\n\n\n\nEvent highlights&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen selecting the right specific highlights to share, consider moments that were the most impactful for attendees. These memorable moments might include videos or&nbsp;event images&nbsp;of standing ovations, surprise moments, or even lively speaking sessions. Be sure to include any measurable outcomes your event might have reached. Did you exceed your fundraising goal? Did your event sell out? Let your attendees know about their incredible impact!\n\n\n\nTestimonials&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSharing quotes and testimonials from attendees can also paint a vivid picture of the event. To gather these testimonials, you could ask attendees during the event about their favorite moments or check if attendees left any meaningful comments on social media that you could highlight (with their permission, of course!). And if your event has a specific cause like a&nbsp;charity fundraiser, reach out to the people that your event is impacting! Hearing direct accounts from the community benefiting from your event will motivate your attendees to continue lending a helping hand!\n\n\n\nVideo clips of your team's thanks&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncorporating a short video clip into your post-event thank-you email adds a dynamic and personal touch. In your video, you can edit clips of your team expressing their gratitude to those who attended! You could also provide a visual recap of your event's highlights, capturing the energy from your event that words alone might struggle to fully convey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Call to action\n\n\n\nYour thank-you participation email should end with a clear call to action (CTA) that'll encourage your readers to take the next step. You typically want one primary CTA and possibly a secondary one, but that's all! Your goal is to direct as many people to completing your CTA as possible. Here are a few ideas of what that could be.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nFill out a survey&nbsp;\u2013 Encourage feedback to show attendees that their opinion matters.\n\n\n\nFollow you on social media&nbsp;- Keep the connection going and boost your social media presence by directing them to your various accounts on&nbsp;Instagram, Facebook, etc.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReserve tickets to upcoming events&nbsp;- Give a sneak peek into other upcoming events and link to where they can secure their tickets.\n\n\n\nWatch a video&nbsp;\u2013 Captivate your readers with a video that'll express your thanks beyond just words!\n\n\n\nSign up for your newsletter&nbsp;- Make sure your attendees are signed up to stay up-to-date with all your latest event news.\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the CTA you choose, you may have the link as a large, bold-colored button near the top or bottom of your email with a short, imperative phrase like \u201cSign Up Now!\u201d or \u201cGet Your Tickets Today!\u201d You may also embed the video or survey form inside your email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Design&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, we've gone through how to write a post-event thank-you email, but what should it look like? A well-designed email is just as important as the words themselves. Opt for a clean and organized layout, making it engaging and easy to read at a glance. And when it comes to visuals, ensure the font and color scheme match your event's branding to drive increased trust with your brand identity. With an aesthetically pleasing email design, your appreciation will be communicated much more effectively!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. CCPA compliance portion\n\n\n\nOne last thing! When it comes to email marketing, it's essential to respect your recipients' privacy. For organizations operating within the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) sets important legal rules for marketers to abide by. The CCPA gives customers the right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared. When crafting your post-event thank-you email templates, ensure you're compliant with the CCPA by being transparent, offering an opt-out option, and having a system in place for data deletion requests.\n\n\n\nDon't forget to thank your team\n\n\n\nFollow-up emails are more than just for your event's attendees! Think about all the moving parts of your event and who helped in making it a success. This could include&nbsp;event sponsors, vendors, speakers, volunteers, and staff. It's important that you express your sincere gratitude to them too for bringing your awesome event to life! By incorporating post-event thank-you emails to these groups in your&nbsp;post-event game plan, you'll cultivate those relationships and excite them to continue working with you in the future. To go even a step further, you could branch out from email and send them a handwritten thank-you note as a small token of your appreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen is the best time to hit send after a successful event?\n\n\n\nChoosing the right time to send your post-event thank-you email is as crucial as its content. After all, you'll want to make every email count! Typically, the optimal time to send your thank-you email is within 24 to 48 hours after the event. This is when their experience is still fresh in your attendees' minds, meaning they're more likely to engage with your email and provide valuable feedback. To help, certain email marketing platforms can determine the ideal send time for the best possible open rates (in general though, it's suggested that 10am and 2pm are prime times for engagement). This way, your thank-you email will not only be heartfelt and engaging, but adequately timed too.\n\n\n\nTracking and measuring success\n\n\n\nThe success of your post-event thank-you email can be measured through a few&nbsp;key analytics. With the following metrics, you can fine-tune your thank-you emails for future events!\n\n\n\nOpen rates&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOpen rates measure how many people click into your email from their inbox. Higher open rates mean your subject line was effective at capturing people's attention and making them eager to read more. According to a&nbsp;Mailerlite study, the target open rate for events is around 36.16%. To help increase your open rates, consider trying the following tips:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nConduct an A\/B test using various subject line variations.\n\n\n\nIncorporate an enticing&nbsp;email preheader&nbsp;that provides recipients with a compelling reason to open.\n\n\n\n\nClick-through rates\n\n\n\nClick-through rates measure how many readers clicked the content within your email (like a video, a CTA button, or links to your socials). Looking at this metric shows whether your content and call to action were compelling enough for readers to take an action. According to the same Mailerlite study as above, the benchmark click-through rate for events is 6.63%. Feel free to try the following tips to improve your click-through rates:\n\n\n\n\nDivide subscribers into more targeted and meaningful segments.\n\n\n\nProvide more enticing incentives to encourage people to click.\n\n\n\nConduct A\/B testing on various email scripts to determine which ones connect better with your audience.\n\n\n\nInclude links to blog posts, surveys, quizzes, or any other valuable content for your audience.\n\n\n\n\nEmail responses\n\n\n\nPeople's responses to your email, particularly by filling out your survey, are great ways to gain insight. In addition to direct feedback, look at any replies to your email, comments on your videos, and anywhere else attendees might share their thoughts about your event. These responses can help you understand what resonated with them the most and what aspects of the event should be improved in the future.\n\n\n\nSample thank-you email templates\n\n\n\nWe've created a few post-event thank-you email examples for different event types with a mixture of various CTAs.

Well, you're in the right place! We'll be sharing some tips and tricks on how to create awesome events that not only impress your attendees but also help protect our planet. From using LED lightbulbs to upcycling decorations, these best practices will give you fresh, creative ways to make your events more sustainable.\n\n\n\nWhat is a sustainable event?\n\n\n\nA sustainable event is one that's organized in a responsible way, leaving a positive impact on the environment and reducing any negative effects. Nowadays, sustainable events are becoming increasingly popular, as people become more aware of the need to protect our planet and our communities. That's why it's crucial to incorporate eco-friendly event planning as much as possible into the various aspects of your event, from your venue choice to your final decorations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBenefits of sustainable event planning&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy utilizing sustainable&nbsp;event planning&nbsp;strategies, not only will you be contributing to a healthier planet and society, but you'll also be saving money on expenses like electricity bills and disposable items. Since many event-goers appreciate events that prioritize sustainability, you'll enhance your reputation and&nbsp;attract more attendees. And on top of all that, you'll feel more accomplished knowing that you're doing your part in promoting social responsibility.\n\n\n\n7 practical ways to make your event more sustainable\n\n\n\nNow that we've covered the fundamentals of sustainability, let's discuss how you can put them into action!\n\n\n\n1. Select a green venue&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen looking for a venue, keep an eye out for places with green certifications or that offer recycling and composting services. Green certifications like&nbsp;LEED&nbsp;or&nbsp;Green Globe&nbsp;show that a venue has taken steps to reduce its environmental impact, making it a considerable choice to practice event sustainability. By choosing a green venue, you're showing your attendees that you care about sustainability, and they'll be more likely to support your events in the future.\n\n\n\n2. Upcycle materials\n\n\n\nUpcycling is a creative way to turn old or discarded items into something new and useful. For example, you can use old jars or wine bottles to create unique centerpieces or planters that will add a touch of charm to your event, like using jars as vases for your flower bouquets. Consider using recycled materials (like reusable fabric or recycled plastic) for your swag bags. As for decorations, refurbished pallets or doors can make cool, rustic backdrops that will impress your guests. As a more specific example, if you're hosting fall events on a farm, try transforming leftover wooden pallets or bales of hay into benches. By upcycling materials, you'll be promoting sustainability, while adding a unique touch to your event.\n\n\n\n3. Practice waste management&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThink classy \u2013 never trashy! Start by opting for reusable types of plates, cutlery, and cups instead of disposable ones. If you do need to use disposable items, choose ones that are compostable or made from recycled materials. Also, if the venue you selected doesn't already offer recycling services, consider setting up some recycling and composting bins around the venue yourself and encourage attendees to use them. Once your event wraps up, consider donating any leftover food to a local food pantry if possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Go paperless\n\n\n\nGoing paperless is an excellent start to eco-friendly event planning. With a&nbsp;ticketing platform&nbsp;like TicketLeap, you'll reduce your paper usage by taking advantage of digital tools like event management software,&nbsp;online registration, and mobile ticketing. Then, during the event itself, you can replace paper programs and agendas with digital versions so attendees can quickly scan a QR code or click a link to access them on their phones. By going paperless, you'll both reduce waste but save money on printing costs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Cater local seasonal foods&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPlan your menu around what's in season and purchase your food from local farmers or suppliers to help reduce your carbon footprint. By doing so, you'll be both supporting local businesses and decreasing how far your food has to travel to your event. Since seasonal foods are those grown and harvested during a particular season, they'll be fresher, tastier, and require fewer resources to transport. Trust us, your guests will go bananas for how delicious and fresh your locally-sourced food is!\n\n\n\n6. Find eco-friendly ways of transportation&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRather than drive in separate cars, encourage your attendees to carpool or use public transportation. On top of helping reduce traffic and air pollution, you'll also promote a sense of community and shared responsibility for the environment. To make it easier for your attendees to use public transportation as an option, consider providing shuttle services to your\u00a0event venue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n7. Minimize energy usage&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy taking even just simple measures, you can significantly reduce your event's energy consumption and support a greener world. For instance, if your event is during the day, open up windows and doors to let in natural sunlight rather than rely on artificial lighting. When you need extra lighting though (like for nighttime events), use energy-efficient bulbs whenever possible since LED lights use up to&nbsp;90% less energy&nbsp;than traditional incandescent bulbs. And be sure to turn off lights whenever they're not in use! You can also save energy by turning off equipment when it's not needed, like projectors, sound systems, and other electronics.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGreen event planning typically looks like small changes that make big differences. Try some of these tips yourself, and fill your attendees in on your efforts to host sustainable events too. As you work to reduce waste and conserve your resources, you'll inspire others to follow your lead. Together we can make a positive impact on the world around us, one small step at a time!\n","date":"7 Nov 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64821d93c06925dbc95661ae_hands-holding-plant-sapling-scaled-1-1024x481.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

Think about it: behind everything from the Olympic games to music festivals and corporate events, there's someone with a clipboard (and maybe a bit of sweat dripping down their forehead) making it all happen. Organizing and planning an event is nothing short of a hefty task, which is why we're here to break down the first steps in successful event organization. When looking for how to plan an event, use these steps and you'll lay a strong, secure foundation for the event of a lifetime.\n\n\n\nLay out your vision\n\n\n\nIf you're planning an event, there's probably a good reason for doing so (and if you're just doing it for fun, we want to be your friend). Events are time-consuming and can be expensive, so it's important to know exactly what you're trying to accomplish at your event. That's why the first step in the event planning process is laying out your goals and objectives. Is your event a fundraiser? A product launch? A celebration of a milestone or corporate success? Pick a mission and event theme before entering your planning stage and ask yourself along the way, \u201cHow does this aspect of my event help further my objectives?\u201d\n\n\n\nAll event planning starts with a spark\u200d\n\n\n\nOnce you know what your event is setting out to accomplish, it's time to evaluate who will be attending (aka, who\u2019s your target audience) and what your revenue goals are. These two aspects are extremely interdependent. Not only is the rest of your planning dependent on being able to accommodate the number of attendees, but you need to define financial goals that these attendees will bring in. With this, it's important to keep in mind the value of your event: is $200 for a ticket a reasonable price, or will your audience not want to pay that much? For example, assume that your sweet spot for attendees is 250 guests. At 250 guests, your venue rental will not be too expensive and will leave greater profit margins. However, needing to accommodate 350 guests might force you to rent a more expensive venue and may lower the profit margins on ticket sales. Once you have a general idea of your goals and objectives, you'll begin to get your creative wheels turning on how your event plan will be executed.\n\n\n\nOrganize a successful event with a reasonable event budget\n\n\n\nBefore planning can begin, it's important to set a realistic event budget during your organizational stages. While some aspects of budget-setting may seem obvious--like venue rental, food, and entertainment--there are aspects of event planning that aren't so clear. You'll need to consider how much you want to spend on marketing, security and personnel, audio and video, and any technology you'll need to keep your event running smoothly. An event planning checklist will be helpful to make sure all these factors are checked off!Luckily, ticketing and event management software can help manage your event budget and drive revenue. Ticketing platforms not only disperse and sell tickets for your event but allow you to create a custom listing for your event. Using this event listing, you can begin promotional efforts for a fraction of the price and event marketing. Additionally, a ticketing platform allows you to manage onsite ticket sales and utilize promotional tools, helping you stay within your budget and maximize the bang for your buck.\n\n\n\nNail down your time and place before you start preparations\n\n\n\nAlmost all of your event management planning will revolve around the time and place of your event. Preparations involving caterers and entertainment, for example, cannot be completed until you can supply a date and location for booking purposes. When choosing your venue and date, there are a variety of factors you need to consider:\n\n\n\nShould I prioritize the date or the venue?\n\n\n\nBe prepared to play a game of give and take if your event must be at either a specific place or on a specific date. You can avoid this by beginning your event planning as far in advance as possible.\n\n\n\nHow will guests arrive?\n\n\n\nIf your event attracts guests from far away, it's important to consider whether access to transportation, parking, and overnight accommodations will be a factor in choosing your event space.\n\n\n\nIs my event near a holiday?\n\n\n\nThough it may seem obvious, be sure that you choose a date that doesn't conflict with major holidays that could prevent your attendees from buying a ticket.\n\n\n\nPartner with other brands to expand your audience\n\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of benefits to finding partners and sponsors for your event. Big brands love to get their names on the hottest events and are often willing to shell out tens of thousands of dollars to get in on the action of your event marketing. \u200dTo find sponsors and partners, there are two main things to keep in mind: act early and act with intention. The whole point of a partner or sponsorship is that it lessens the financial risk of your company alone. However, many large companies plan financial sponsorships at the beginning of a fiscal year, so event planners need to act early in finding sponsorships. Additionally, it's important to be intentional when choosing your partners. Be sure that the brand's mission is aligned with yours. This not only ensures that the even is beneficial for all partners involved, but can help foster opportunities for ongoing event promotion partnerships.Organizing and planning an event can seem daunting at first.

In this guide, we'll dive into the essential steps for planning and executing a successful fundraising event for your nonprofit organization. Now, let's get ready to embark on a journey that'll empower your team to make a bigger impact on the world!\n\n\n\n1. Establish your nonprofit's fundraising purpose\n\n\n\nA nonprofit event's success hinges on establishing a clear purpose. After all, the event's objectives will serve as the foundation for your promotional strategy, which in turn will guide your decision-making to raise money and attract supporters. Start by asking yourself&nbsp;important questions about your fundraiser&nbsp;like what target audience you hope to resonate with or what ways you want to build a buzz for your cause. By incorporating this knowledge into your strategies, you'll be well on your way to creating a charity event that resonates with that audience and helps raise awareness.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you're organizing a flag football tournament to raise awareness for a children's hospital and collect donations, consider additional efforts like a raffle to boost excitement and encourage people to donate, even if they aren't sports fans. Additionally, incorporating peer-to-peer fundraising strategies (such as having participants set up fundraising webpages and asking for donations ahead of time) can help increase engagement and your overall fundraising success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying your event objectives\n\n\n\nWhether your aim is to inspire people to take action, reach a new audience, or grow your nonprofit, having clear objectives will guide your decision-making throughout the&nbsp;event planning process.\n\n\n\nYou'll want these event objectives to be as specific and quantifiable as possible (aka,&nbsp;SMART goals). For example, rather than have your goal be something general like raise awareness for the homeless in your community, your goal could be to reach a realistic fundraising target towards building a new homeless shelter. Or, if you're raising funds for a sporting event, you should have a specific dollar amount to shoot for. That way, you'll be able to track your fundraising target alongside your donors, and use creative options to present your benchmarks like a huge thermometer or themed roadmap to show your progress.\n\n\n\nAligning your event with your nonprofit's mission\n\n\n\nTo align your event with your nonprofit's values, consider how all the activities leading up to, during, and after your event day will both engage donors and raise more money. Choose&nbsp;fundraising ideas for your event&nbsp;that resonate with your attendee demographic, like a marathon for fitness enthusiasts or a charity concert for music-lovers. You may also want to&nbsp;live stream your event&nbsp;to make it even more accessible.\n\n\n\nBy connecting your event to your mission, you'll not only create a consistent message but also draw in supporters who are passionate about your cause.\n\n\n\n2. Build a comprehensive event budget\n\n\n\nYour charity event (and reaching those fundraising goals!) is made possible with a comprehensive event budget. By mapping out your expenses and securing sponsorships, you can ensure that you're raising more money than you're spending, ultimately contributing to your event's success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping out your expenses\n\n\n\nWhen creating your event budget, you'll need to consider expenses such as:\n\n\n\n\nVenue rental\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nMarketing materials\n\n\n\nCatering\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nUtilities\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to leave some wiggle room in your budget to account for unexpected costs, ensuring that you have enough funds to cover all your expenses. By listing all your expenses and estimating their costs, you'll have a clearer picture of the financial resources needed to host a successful fundraiser. With a thorough understanding of your expenses, you can set a fundraising goal that's both achievable and ambitious, maximizing the impact of your nonprofit.\n\n\n\nDetermining your revenue streams\n\n\n\nMapping out where your revenue will come from is the next piece that's crucial to reaching your fundraising goal. These may include:\n\n\n\n\nCharitable donations\n\n\n\nTicket sales\n\n\n\nSponsorships\n\n\n\nLive auctions\n\n\n\nSilent auctions\n\n\n\nRaffle tickets\n\n\n\nCrowdfunding\n\n\n\n\nHaving reasonable benchmarks for each revenue stream will help you determine how much money you'll put towards your ultimate fundraising goal after covering the event's expenses. This will also help you determine the&nbsp;best ticket price&nbsp;for your event for reaching your revenue goals. You can also use TicketLeap's platform to solicit additional donations!\n\n\n\nSecuring your sponsorships\n\n\n\nSeeking sponsorships&nbsp;from businesses and individuals can help cover event costs and increase your fundraising potential. By reaching out to local businesses for sponsorships, you can reduce costs and allocate more of your budget towards engaging donors and raising money for your cause. As another option, you could have multiple vendors from local restaurants onsite to show their support to your cause and offer free food to your event-goers.\n\n\n\nTo find sponsorships, start with people and businesses you know and work your way outward. Ask your board members and other people involved if they know anyone who could help, and explore companies that sponsor similar events in your area.\n\n\n\nWhen negotiating the terms of your&nbsp;sponsorship package, be prepared to explain the value of your event and be open to negotiating the terms. By securing sponsorships, you'll be one step closer to hosting an effective fundraising event.\n\n\n\n3. Create memorable experiences for your target audience\n\n\n\nPlanning a successful charity event necessitates reaching your target audience. This means you'll want to put together a lineup of activities that resonate with the people you're trying to reach. Tailoring your event experience to that audience will help you engage attendees and encourage more participation.\n\n\n\nBy selecting the right venue, theme, and lineup of entertainment, you'll create an unforgettable experience that'll leave a lasting impression on your attendees. And don't forget to showcase all these details on&nbsp;your event page&nbsp;to attract more participants too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting your venue and theme\n\n\n\nChoosing a venue\u00a0and theme that aligns with your mission and resonates with your attendees is crucial for creating a successful event. The venue and theme should be inviting and engaging, reflecting the values and goals of your nonprofit.\n\n\n\nWhen selecting a venue and theme, consider the preferences of your audience and the objectives of your event. For example, if your nonprofit focuses on environmental conservation, you could choose a local park as your venue and incorporate&nbsp;eco-friendly practices&nbsp;throughout the event. Or, if your nonprofit supports the arts, consider a community theater or somewhere with a stage for you to showcase local talent. You could also orient your charity event's theme around an upcoming holiday like Christmas, Thanksgiving or&nbsp;Halloween.\n\n\n\nYour venue is often one of your greatest costs, so choose wisely! You may consider using a space your organization already readily uses or looking into places that may donate their space in support of your next fundraising event. You'll also want to verify the accessibility of your venue to ensure it's&nbsp;more inclusive&nbsp;to all your attendees. Offering a live stream or other virtual event could expand your fundraiser's bandwidth of attendees as well. By selecting a venue and theme that resonates with your audience, you'll be more likely to attract attendees and encourage their support for your cause.\n\n\n\nIncorporating entertainment and activities\n\n\n\nPutting together an agenda jam-packed with engaging activities tailored to your audience is essential for creating a memorable event experience. By offering interactive elements, such as games, raffles, and auctions, you can encourage donations and keep attendees entertained throughout the event. Invite speakers to share motivational stories and testimonials about the work of your nonprofit. You could also incorporate musicians or local celebrities into your lineup of activities to both advocate for your cause and entertain your guests. Or, your nonprofit could organize a raffle with prizes donated by local businesses or individuals. Don't be afraid to think outside of the box!\n\n\n\n4. Recruit volunteers and staff\n\n\n\nVolunteers and staff play a vital role in your event, from assisting with registration and collecting donations to providing support and guidance to attendees. Lean on your organization's current roster of employees and volunteers for support, and assess whether you need additional help for your event. By effectively&nbsp;recruiting your staff&nbsp;and event volunteers, you'll be better equipped to handle any challenges that may arise and ensure a positive experience for all your attendees.\n\n\n\nTo help enlist volunteers, spread the word through your nonprofit's network, post on social media, and reach out to local groups and businesses. You should consider using an event registration page for volunteer candidates to sign up. Make sure to provide volunteers with a clear understanding of their responsibilities and offer training materials, videos, or webinars to help them prepare. By investing in volunteer recruitment and training, you'll be better equipped to handle any challenges that may arise during your event and ensure a successful outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinating staff responsibilities\n\n\n\nDefining staff roles and responsibilities is crucial for maintaining organization and efficiency during your event. By assigning tasks based on staff skills and experience, you can ensure that each role is filled by someone qualified and capable of doing the job.\n\n\n\nFigure out where each person's strengths and weaknesses reside, then do your best to assign them to the role that suits them the best. By effectively coordinating staff responsibilities, you can rest assured your event is set to run smoothly.\n\n\n\n5. Implement donation collection methods\n\n\n\nMaximizing your fundraising potential depends on implementing effective donation collection methods. By choosing the right platforms and encouraging donor engagement, you can increase the funds raised for your cause and create a lasting impact.\n\n\n\nChoose user-friendly donation platforms that cater to your audience's preferences and ensure secure processing, such as TicketLeap for&nbsp;online nonprofit ticketing&nbsp;or PayPal for on-the-spot payments. Make use of interactive activities and clear communication of your nonprofit's impact, which will motivate attendees to contribute to your cause and help you reach your fundraising goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right platforms\n\n\n\nSelecting the right donation platforms is crucial for ensuring a seamless and secure donation process for your attendees. User-friendly and secure platforms, such as GoFundMe, Bloomerang, or PayPal, can cater to your audience's preferences and make it easy for them to contribute to your cause.\n\n\n\nBy offering multiple donation options, you can accommodate the preferences of your target audience and make it as easy as possible to donate, so you can reach your fundraising goals even faster.\n\n\n\nEncouraging donor engagement\n\n\n\nOffering interactive activities, such as games, raffles, and auctions, can help create a fun and memorable experience for attendees while also encouraging them to contribute to your cause. In addition to interactive activities, clearly communicating the impact of your nonprofit's work can inspire donors to contribute to your cause. By sharing stories, data, and the successes of your nonprofit, you can demonstrate the results of your organization's efforts, which may motivate donors to contribute more.\n\n\n\n6. Develop your marketing strategy\n\n\n\nCreating a multi-channel&nbsp;event marketing strategy&nbsp;is essential for effectively promoting your event and attracting attendees. By utilizing digital channels such as email and social media, as well as traditional methods like flyers, direct mail, or radio ads, you can maximize your event's reach and sell more tickets to your fundraiser.\n\n\n\nTo promote your charitable events, consider the following strategies:\n\n\n\n\nTap into your nonprofit's network of friends and supporters\n\n\n\nSend out&nbsp;email invites&nbsp;to current donors\n\n\n\nPost flyers in popular venues around town\n\n\n\nEngage with local businesses for sponsorship or partnership opportunities\n\n\n\nPut out a&nbsp;press release&nbsp;and appear on local news stations to&nbsp;build publicity\n\n\n\nShare the link to your event page as much as possible! (on social media, email campaigns, websites, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can spread the word about your awesome fundraiser events!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverage the power of social media\n\n\n\nSocial media should play a significant part of your nonprofit's marketing strategy. Create a&nbsp;Facebook event&nbsp;that you, your sponsors, and your followers can share to help spread the word. Be sure to link to your event's website or ticketing page to get the full event details and sell tickets to your fundraiser.\n\n\n\nTo encourage attendees to share your event page with their friends, host a ticket giveaway for your next event that they can enter by tagging a few people and resharing your post. Create&nbsp;short-form video content on TikTok&nbsp;and Instagram that highlights all the exciting things your charity event has to offer and how your nonprofit is impacting the community. You could also start a challenge or trend using a branded event hashtag on your posts and encourage others to do the same. If you have some extra room in your budget, you could boost event-related social media ads to your target market as well. There are plenty of unique things you can try to promote your event, so don't be afraid to try something a little out there!\n\n\n\n7. Prep for your big day\n\n\n\nAll your plans have finally come together, and now the big day is here! Get to the venue early to ensure everything is in order. Touch base with your event staff and special guests so everyone's on the same page about how the day's agenda will go. You'll want to do a test run of any sound equipment or other technology you'll be using too.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of details that go into those final moments of preparation before everyone arrives, so we've created an&nbsp;event day checklist&nbsp;to help you! Ultimately, the key to a smooth event day is extensive preparation. That way, once your charity event starts, you can enjoy it alongside your attendees!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Follow up after your fundraising event\n\n\n\nCongrats! You've successfully planned and pulled together your event. But you aren't done yet! Maintaining your relationships with those attendees, volunteers, and sponsors are dependent on conducting post-event follow-ups and evaluations. By expressing gratitude to all those who contributed to your event and measuring its success, you can ensure that your nonprofit continues to grow and thrive.\n\n\n\nEvaluating the success of your event involves measuring key performance indicators, such as the amount of funds raised, attendee satisfaction, and social media engagement. By&nbsp;analyzing these metrics, you can gain valuable insights into what worked well and what could be improved for future charity events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressing gratitude\n\n\n\nSending thank-you messages to attendees, volunteers, and sponsors is an important part of your post-event strategy. By expressing your appreciation for them you can maintain relationships with those who contributed to your event's success and foster a sense of community around your cause.\n\n\n\nPersonalized thank-you messages can help strengthen your connections with attendees, volunteers, and sponsors. By including their name, mentioning the event they attended or supported, and expressing your appreciation for their contribution, you can show your gratitude and encourage their continued involvement with your nonprofit. You should be as detailed as possible in letting attendees know how their support is helping your cause too, sharing videos and testimonials of how the money raised is impacting people in your community. That way, not only will they be glad they attended your event, you could turn them into recurring donors!\n\n\n\nMeasuring event success\n\n\n\nEvaluating key performance indicators, such as ticket sales, attendee satisfaction, and social media engagement, is a crucial part of measuring the success of your charity events. In your follow-up email, send out a survey for attendees to share what they loved about your charity event and where it can improve. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain valuable insights into what worked well and what could be improved for future charity events.\n\n\n\nApplying the results of your event evaluation to future planning can help your nonprofit to grow and thrive. By identifying areas for improvement and building on your successes, you can create even more impactful events that raise additional funds and awareness for your cause. By continually learning and adapting, your nonprofit can make a lasting difference in the world.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nThere you have it! Now you're ready to kick off your latest fundraiser and any future events you may host for your nonprofit. By following these steps and continually learning from your experiences, your nonprofit can host impactful events that raise funds and awareness for your cause.\n\n\n\nAs you embark on your journey to plan your fundraising events, TicketLeap's&nbsp;user-friendly ticketing platform&nbsp;is here to help empower your organization and your events to make a bigger impact on the world.

It's the complete foundation upon which your attendee experience unfolds. But hold on a second! Selecting an event venue is about more than aesthetics and ambiance; it's a strategic move that sets the stage for future decision-making. Think about it: picking the right venue can make or break your ticket sales, determine the rest of your budget, and influence the other factors event organizers need to juggle. So, how about we help you out? In this guide on how to find the perfect event venue, we've got step-by-step instructions, helpful tips, and plenty of inspiration to ensure that your event stands out from the crowd. Let's get started!\n\n\n\nImportance of venue selection for an event\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to\u00a0planning your event, booking the right venue is crucial. It's oftentimes your largest cost and the backbone of your events, setting the tone of your attendees' overall experience. Whether you're organizing an annual festival, a head-banging concert, a thrilling holiday party, or a heartfelt charity fundraiser, every event is unique in its own way. Thus, tailoring your venue selection to your specific event is key. Depending on its convenience, ease of parking, and other factors, your event's location can play a huge role in whether people will show up or not.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen should you start booking event venues?\n\n\n\nBooking a venue for an event depends on a few factors. First, getting the ideal date depends on your event date's flexibility. The more flexible you are with your event date, the better chance you'll have at securing a sweet deal. Second, and perhaps most importantly, it depends on the venue's general availability, especially if it's a high-demand location. Event venues often have varying rates depending on the day of the week or the season, so exploring alternative dates might just save you some money, which you can reinvest back into your event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe key here is to plan your event as far in advance as possible. By doing so, you not only increase your chances of securing that perfect date, but also you can ensure you'll get the best rates for it. Rushing into booking a venue can end up costing you more money, since last-minute availability tends to come with a premium price tag.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it's always a good idea to add buffer time before your event day for unexpected accommodations or adjustments. This way, you'll be prepared for any surprises that may arise during the planning process. So, remember to plan ahead, consider flexibility, and give yourself ample time to secure the right venue for your event. Your wallet will thank you, and your attendees will be impressed with your well-planned event.\n\n\n\nHow would you go about searching for the right venue?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to searching for event venues, it's important to utilize all your available resources. First and foremost, consider any venue options that your organization may already have. Reach out to colleagues, friends, and industry contacts in your network to see if they have any recommendations on suitable venues. This could include leveraging existing partnerships, like reaching out to\u00a0your sponsors\u00a0who may have access to potential venues.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, take a look at other venues that have been used for popular events in your area. These venues are likely to have extensive experience hosting events and may offer attractive packages. Of course, don't forget the power of a simple Google search and online venue search platforms. These platforms allow you to filter and compare potential venues based on factors like size, location, and amenities. Social media can also be a helpful tool here for you to check out events similar to yours and see where they're hosted.\n\n\n\nFinally, consider public venues managed by your town or city. This type of venue offers unique spaces and amenities, but keep in mind that special permits or permissions may be required. By utilizing these various resources, you'll be sure to find the perfect venue that aligns with your event goals and budget!\n\n\n\nSchedule site visits\n\n\n\nOnce you have narrowed down your list of potential venues, it's time to schedule site visits to examine their suitability for your event. To begin, reach out to your top choices and set up appointments for the site visits. During these visits, prepare a list of questions and needs that you want to discuss with the venue representatives. This could include inquiries about capacity, available amenities, catering options, technical capabilities, and any specific venue requirements for an event. You can also give the venue space (i.e. lobby, restrooms, meeting rooms) a quality check to ensure it meets your standards.\n\n\n\nBy having a prepared list of questions, you can ensure that all your concerns are addressed upfront and that you gather all the necessary information to make your final decision. Distinguish between your \"must-haves\" and your \"nice-to-haves\" when looking at your venue. That way, you can determine which factors are non-negotiable for your event versus which are preferences that would be great to have but are not deal-breakers. This distinction will help you prioritize and evaluate the venues based on how well they meet your specific needs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n15 factors event planners should consider in venue selection\n\n\n\nWhen narrowing down your venue options, there are a number of factors to consider in venue selection for your events. Getting clarification on these upfront ensures you're setting yourself up for success with a smooth\u00a0event day. Now, let's dive in!\n\n\n\n1. Venue cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen selecting an event venue, cost is one of the largest factors. This goes beyond just the flat rental fee for the venue too. It's important to inquire about any extra fees for rentals that may apply, such as charges for extra services or amenities. Ask the venue manager upfront what is included in the price and what is not (like taxes or add-on services). Additionally, it's important to ensure that the rental time includes sufficient venue access for both setup and breakdown. Moreover, it's crucial to budget for additional costs outside of the venue rental fee. These costs can include expenses such as catering, audiovisual equipment, decorations, staffing, and permits. By accounting for these costs upfront for your overall event budget, you can avoid unexpected bills later!\n\n\n\n2. Event date availability\n\n\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the flexibility of your event date matters! In particular, seasonality can play a significant role in determining the availability and the cost of certain venues. If your event falls around popular holidays or peak seasons, a venue's business may be in high demand, meaning higher prices. Moreover, weekend events are typically more popular than weekdays, and venues may have limited availability or at least cost you more. If you have some flexibility, venues may even offer discounted rates for off-peak dates or last-minute availability.&nbsp;However, if you have a preferred date in mind, you may need to pay a premium price for securing that specific date. Evaluate what your budget is and how much you're willing to spend in order to secure your ideal venue at your preferred time and date.\n\n\n\nBooking for multi-day events\n\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is whether you require multiple dates for your event. For instance, corporate events or multi-day festivals may need consecutive dates. In such cases, ensure that the venue can accommodate your schedule and discuss the possibility of discounted rates for booking multiple dates.\n\n\n\nInclement weather accommodations\n\n\n\nIf you plan to have an outdoor event, it's crucial to have a contingency plan for inclement weather. Inquire with potential venues on whether they provide options for rescheduling or if they have auxiliary event spaces available indoors. Having the ability to schedule a rain date ensures that your event can proceed smoothly, even if the weather is a bit unpredictable.\n\n\n\n3. Ideal location\n\n\n\nThis will really help put your event on the map (literally)! The ideal location takes your target audience into account. Being in proximity to where your attendees live makes it convenient for them to reach the venue's location, increasing the likelihood that they'll come. It should be an easy-to-find location, and ideally one close to transportation like buses or airports with nearby hotel accommodations. Depending on your budget, picking a memorable venue type to host events (like at a rooftop garden, winery, or historic house) can seriously elevate your experience as well and give attendees lasting memories, so they want to come back for your next event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Comfortable atmosphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoinciding with the general location, you'll also want to prioritize guests' comfort once they're inside your venue space. First impressions of your event are important, so you'll definitely want to impress attendees from the start! Not only is your venue the foundation of your attendees' experience, it's also the background to all your\u00a0event photography\u00a0and promotional materials. So, make it count! Find a place that fits the style of your event, whether that be a cozy, homestyle feel or a more sleek, modern look. The more you like the interior of the building, the less decorating you may have to do. That said, there's something powerful about a blank slate as well! Additionally, consider scheduling your site visits around the same time as your event will happen so you can assess how the natural lighting might impact how your venue looks.\n\n\n\n5. Event venue capacity\n\n\n\nMake sure you carefully consider the capacity of the event space. One must be mindful of how the number of people will navigate your venue. Ensuring that the chosen venue can legally and comfortably accommodate the intended number of guests is essential to create a pleasant experience for everyone. Triple-check whether the event space requirements account for seated or standing room only when researching options. This will be important to avoid overcrowding and make sure that seating doesn't get too tight, as well as to follow safety protocols. You'll also want to have enough space for any preferred vendors and sponsors' booths too. Depending on your expected number of people, there can be value in selecting smaller event venues that have the potential to sell out faster, creating an atmosphere of exclusivity and excitement!\n\n\n\n6. Floor layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosting a successful event ensures every person feels comfortable, engaged, and has an unforgettable experience. The floor layout of your chosen venue plays a pivotal role in achieving that. From the seating arrangement to table placement, every detail contributes to the overall ambiance. Use clear and obvious signage that attendees can easily read, ensuring a hassle-free experience. But it doesn't stop there! Whether you need a stage for performances or a dance floor for vibing, confirm that the right venue has the elements you need to fulfill your vision for the event.\n\n\n\nConsider where to place your\u00a0event's registration\u00a0table for check-in and how you'll accommodate the flow of people entering and exiting. And let's not forget about foot traffic throughout your event. By strategically setting up multiple stations, multiple check-ins, and catering areas as needed, you'll eliminate bottlenecks and keep the flow smooth. Safety is paramount, so verify that it's easy to get to emergency exits too. To help with this, lay out an illustrated floor plan that both staff and attendees can reference.\n\n\n\n7. Accessibility\n\n\n\nTo make your venue accessible to all attendees, verify that there are elevators and ramps as needed so individuals with mobility aids can navigate the space with ease. Ample seating should be provided, especially for an older crowd, to ensure each person is comfortable throughout the event. For families with young kids, ensure there are changing stations available and other potential accommodations like certain rooms dedicated for kids. By taking these accessibility measures into account, event organizers can create an\u00a0inclusive and welcoming environment\u00a0for all attendees.\n\n\n\n8. Food and drink suppliers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fantastic event is one where great food, drinks, and memories come together! If you're planning to have food at your event, clarify whether you'll need to arrange this separately or if the venue will take care of it. If the venue is in charge of the food, remember to consider the minimum number of guests they plan to serve and make sure to invite at least that many people. If you're providing your own or recruiting other food vendors to do your catering, check if the venue has a kitchen available to store and prepare the food. Should you want a bar at your event, ask if the venue has a designated bar area or if they can arrange for bar services. By addressing these aspects, you'll ensure that your guests are well fed and hydrated!\n\n\n\n9. Additional services\n\n\n\nDepending on the size of the prospective venue and your available budget, you may want to ask about services that are included in your contract versus what the venue will provide for an additional cost. Some areas may include:\n\n\n\n\nTraffic control\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nWaste management\n\n\n\nFurniture rental service (e.g., tables, chairs, linens, silverware)\n\n\n\nTransportation (e.g., shuttle services)\n\n\n\nTents, fans, and\/or heating units for outdoor events\n\n\n\nAdditional event staffing\n\n\n\n\nYour needs will vary depending on whether your event is indoors or outdoors, what size it is, and more. Share your complete vision with the venue manager to ensure you've got all your bases covered, allowing you to determine additional services to secure.\n\n\n\n10. Parking availability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParking is a critical aspect of selecting a venue that you should also strategize at a given venue (your guests will have to put their cars somewhere!). Is there ample parking space onsite or nearby? Are there any restrictions or additional fees associated with parking? By addressing these questions, you can give your event attendees peace of mind about finding a parking spot, especially if they can avoid street parking or paying for it. Easy access to a parking lot not only saves time but also enhances the overall experience, allowing attendees to arrive smoothly and let them focus on enjoying the event. If your budget allows for it, you may even consider offering valet service so it's one less thing your attendees need to think about.\n\n\n\n11. Quality of acoustics\n\n\n\nWhen considering a venue for your event, it's important to assess the quality of the acoustics. Wondering if the sound is up to par? Don't hesitate to ask the venue owner about typical comments they receive regarding the sound quality at previous events. It's worth noting that venues with low ceilings tend to amplify sound, while open spaces can create excessive reverb, which may affect clarity. Finding a good balance is key, ensuring that the sound is neither too quiet nor too loud.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n12. Insurance needs\n\n\n\nInsurance requirements will vary depending on the nature and size of the venue. Many times, the venue will have liability insurance covered, so be sure to ask. Some larger venues may have stricter requirements, mandating that event organizers have insurance coverage in place even before negotiating the terms.\n\n\n\nIt is important to communicate with the venue and inquire about the specific insurance requirements and who is responsible for providing them. If a larger venue does not require any insurance or if the coverage seems inadequate, it could be a red flag. Adequate insurance coverage ensures the protection of both the event organizer and the venue, offering peace of mind and safeguarding against unforeseen circumstances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n13. Ample technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour technology needs depend entirely on what kind of event you're organizing. Do you need a projector for presentations? How about a sound system for your entertainment or keynote speakers? Check with the venue manager regarding what resources they have available versus what equipment you'll need to bring yourself. This could include anything from additional lighting to audio-visual equipment. And don't forget about WiFi! Check that your selected venue has strong WiFi available for your attendees to connect to.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n14. Cancellation policy\n\n\n\nThere's always some uncertainty when organizing events. Because of that, you'll want to know the venue's cancellation policy to avoid any unwanted surprises. Should you need to cancel your event, ask the venue if they have a percentage refund policy based on how far in advance you cancel. Clarify whether you'll still be charged a cancellation fee if the event needs to be rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances (like inclement weather). By proactively addressing these questions based on how they've handled past events, you can ensure that you are well informed about the cancellation policy and make decisions with confidence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n15. Ticketing protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need to check if you should sell your tickets through their venue's provider or if you can use your own. Many venues will let you use a do-it-yourself system like&nbsp;, while others may have a set contract with a specific ticketing service already.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVoil\u00e0! You've got all your bases covered on what to consider when booking your next event. Every event's needs are different, so communicate them as clearly as possible with your venue manager. And once you're ready to host your event,\u00a0TicketLeap's user-friendly system\u00a0is fully prepared to sell your tickets. In the end, you'll look back with confidence knowing your selected venue is the best fit for your event!\n","date":"7 Nov 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6548ec71e6b8ee052ad53190_confetti-at-concert-venue-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

These two essential principles are key ingredients towards unlocking the full potential of your events and celebrating the richness of human differences. Eager to learn more? Let's explore how to make events inclusive!\n\n\n\nWhat is diversity and inclusion?\n\n\n\nDiversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) refers to the essential principles of fostering a sense of belonging, respect, and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, abilities, or characteristics. Simply put, diversity refers to the rich variety of people's differences, including (but certainly not limited to!) race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and religion. As its closely linked yet distinct counterpart, inclusion emphasizes creating an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to participate fully, without facing discrimination or prejudice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nD&amp;I benefits our communities because it broadens our perspectives and ultimately leads to a more enriching experience for all attendees. Some common barriers to achieving D&amp;I at your events include unconscious biases, limited awareness, and insufficient representation, which can hinder authentic connections with and among your entire audience. Overcoming these challenges requires proactive effort and a commitment to creating inclusive events.\n\n\n\nIncorporating diversity and inclusion in your event planning\n\n\n\nConsider setting clear goals in your&nbsp;event checklist&nbsp;related to D&amp;I, like actively seeking out underrepresented communities or incorporating more inclusive&nbsp;event planning practices&nbsp;in various aspects of your event (e.g., speaker selection, marketing materials, venue choice). To help guide these efforts, engage with community leaders and advocates to understand specific groups, so you can tailor your events to resonate with their interests in an authentic way. Establishing&nbsp;event sponsorships&nbsp;with a diverse array of organizations helps connect us to a broader spectrum of voices too. Other examples of D&amp;I-related planning efforts could include verifying that the venue you book has certain accessibility accommodations, selecting a date for your event that doesn't land on a religious observance day, or ensuring language interpretation services are available.\n\n\n\nPromoting your events with diversity and inclusion in mind\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that genuinely connecting with your audience lies at the heart of successful event marketing! Here are a few ways to improve your&nbsp;marketing materials&nbsp;and better engage with specific communities:\n\n\n\n\nFeature individuals from different backgrounds on your promotional materials, website, and&nbsp;ticketing page&nbsp;to prioritize more representation in your imagery, helping your event resonate with a wide range of attendees and better welcome diversity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCreate colorblind-friendly marketing materials (e.g., your website, social media ads, flyers) by minimizing&nbsp;certain color combinations&nbsp;close together like red and green or purple and blue.\n\n\n\nIncorporate a brief written description to your images on your event's website (known as image alt text) so visually impaired individuals using screen readers can comprehend your visuals and graphics.\n\n\n\nOffer your marketing materials in different languages. To help you prioritize which translations to provide, take a look at the demographics of your target audience and choose the common languages spoken among them.\n\n\n\nInclude captions in your videos to ensure participants who are deaf or hard of hearing can fully enjoy your content.\n\n\n\nParticipate in online communities or forums that align with your event's theme to help build meaningful connections and encourage diverse audiences to join your event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCreate content that reflects the varied interests of different communities to attract a more diverse attendee base.\n\n\n\n\nMaking your event's venue more inclusive&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, it's time to\u00a0choose the perfect venue\u00a0for your event! When selecting a venue, confirm that it has accessibility options, making it easy for people with disabilities or mobility challenges to navigate your event space comfortably. This could include providing accessible parking, elevator access, as well as wheelchair-accessible ramps and seating.\u00a0Live streaming\u00a0your in-person event and hosting additional\u00a0virtual events\u00a0can give even more people the opportunity to enjoy your event remotely (especially those who might not be able to attend otherwise). You may also consider whether your venue has gender-neutral bathrooms available for those who may desire them.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you're serving food, ensure your menu has vegetarian, vegan, and other options for those with dietary restrictions. Think about how your range of food options could cater to people of different cultural backgrounds and create a welcoming atmosphere for all attendees.&nbsp;To help you in these efforts, TicketLeap lets you add&nbsp;custom registration questions&nbsp;at checkout, so you can let your ticket buyers request any specific accommodations they might need.\n\n\n\nFostering diversity and inclusion at your event&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow that you've got your event planning down, let's cover some strategies to enrich your attendees' experience on the day of!\n\n\n\n\nTrain your event staff on how to create an inclusive environment for all attendees, free from any unconscious bias. Set clear guidelines that emphasize treating every attendee with equal respect and consideration.\n\n\n\nConsider&nbsp;hiring bilingual staff&nbsp;or translators to assist attendees in their native language.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEncourage your diverse array of sponsors to engage with attendees on topics they're passionate about and spread awareness regarding relevant social issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOrganize fun activities that require attendees to work together in diverse teams to promote cross-cultural collaboration.\n\n\n\nUse decorations and signage that reflect a wide range of cultures, identities, and perspectives. This can create a more welcoming environment and help your attendees feel more represented.\n\n\n\n\nImproving your future diversity and inclusion efforts\n\n\n\nWhen hosting your diverse event ideas, it's important to continually evaluate whether your efforts are sufficiently and authentically promoting diversity and inclusion at your events. Sending out a&nbsp;post-event survey&nbsp;to your attendees is definitely a great idea to gauge the effectiveness of your D&amp;I initiatives. Through your questionnaire, you could gain their feedback on whether they've felt included, whether your efforts successfully represented various communities, and where you can improve for the future. Armed with these insights, you can take proactive steps to ensure your future events are more diverse and inclusive!\n","date":"7 Nov 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64d4d876222fa3b6dc857f15_diverse-group-of-young-people-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

You're already an expert on selling tickets online for free (just pass those fees along to your ticket buyers!) But now it's time to promote your event, and wouldn't you like to do that for free, too? We've compiled our 17 best tips to sell more tickets online for free (or pretty close to free).\n\n\n\n1. Facebook is your friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust about everyone (as in&nbsp;2.9 billion&nbsp;active monthly users) is on Facebook. Access to that many potential ticket buyers is enough reason to use it.\n\n\n\n2. The early bird gets the deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffer ticket discounts to get people to buy more tickets and to buy early. From early bird to word of mouth deals, there are lots of options for you to try.\n\n\n\n3. Show them what they're missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind people how much fun they had (or could have had) at your last event. This means you'll need to&nbsp;take lots of great photos&nbsp;and videos during the event so you can post them to social media later. You don't need a fancy camera; your iPhone or Android will do the trick. When your next event comes, the fun you captured will be your best promotional tool.\n\n\n\n4. #Hashtag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an event hashtag and share it often. Make sure it's visible on the website you're selling tickets on, and use it in your social media posts when talking about your event.\n\n\n\n5. A picture's worth a thousand words...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen ticket buyers land on your event page, keep their attention by showing them a great image that encompasses your event. This image should make them excited for your event and confident they'll have a great time.\n\n\n\n6. ...But words are pretty important, too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a detailed\u00a0event description, whether you're using your own website or a third-party event page. Descriptive event information lets them know what's included with their ticket and what they should expect from the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Get people talking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter what social media platform you prefer, make sure to post consistently (2-4 times per week) so that your event stays visible. Use interesting or funny pictures and videos\u2014the kind that will make people want to tag their friends in your post. Check out #17 below for tips on how to make your posts look as impressive as your event is (even if you're not a designer).\n\n\n\n8. Alert the media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick a few news outlets you'd like to see your event featured in and reach out to the person who writes about events like yours\u2014usually the Entertainment Editor. Send them an email with the who, what, where, when, why of your event to make it easy for them to write about it. Local blogs can also be a great resource if your event has a niche audience (your yoga in the park event would fit right in with a local fitness blogger's content).\n\n\n\n9. Make sure the price is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your ticket price&nbsp;to convey value to your event goers. People want to feel like their money and their time are well spent. While it may be tempting to price your tickets low to increase sales, a too-low price tag can signal low quality to potential buyers. Don't sell yourself (or your event) short.\n\n\n\n10. Use influencers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk prominent people in your community to help spread the word and give them something in return. Ask them to send personalized&nbsp;email invitations&nbsp;to their networks, or tweet and post about the event in exchange for a comped or discounted ticket. Make it easy on them by giving them pre-written prompts or posts you'd like them to use.\n\n\n\n11. Give 'em some swag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork with a local restaurant or merchant to get some cool gifts for attendees. If you can't figure out enough for every attendee, create a contest\u2014you'll want to make sure the gifts are cool and\/or useful! Think about the setting of your event and how your attendees will feel when they're there. Rainy day? Hand out some ponchos with your logo (or your sponsor's logo) on them. Is your event outdoors in the middle of summer? Branded reusable water bottles! Your attendees will appreciate\u00a0swag they can actually use.\n\n\n\n12. Up your Instagram game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over a billion users and growing, Instagram is a perfect platform for promoting your event. You'll want to make sure the image you post is good enough to make people stop scrolling and pay attention, so make sure your pictures look great. Since you can't use an active link in your instagram captions (Instagram doesn't have this feature), include the link to your event page in your bio, and include the words \u201clink in bio\u201d in your caption so your followers know to look for it!\n\n\n\n13. Let your dirty work do double duty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou work hard to make sure your event goers have a great experience, so why not double the return on your investment? Snap some pictures of the behind-the-scenes process (think blowing up balloons to create a balloon pit or hammering the last nail into your homemade replica of the throne from Game of Thrones) and post to social for added hype.\n\n\n\n14. Give away your tickets for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, some of them, anyway.&nbsp;Reserve a few tickets&nbsp;for a social media promotion where people have to share your event, use your hashtag, or somehow interact with you on social for a chance to win free tickets.\n\n\n\n15. See my guest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes your event have a high-profile guest? Let their recognizable image stand in for some of your regular advertising. (Don't forget: this is promotion for them, too.) Tweet out a great pic of them or use a tool like&nbsp;WordSwag&nbsp;to post a quote of theirs on Instagram. There's basically no work for you since guests like these bring their own hype.\n\n\n\n16. A word from your sponsor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsorships are a great tool&nbsp;for cross-promotion. Did you find an awesome local restaurant to donate food for your event? Great work! Now promote them (and your event) by reposting a tasty-looking pic of their food on your Instagram. Your potential ticket buyers will be tempted by what they could be eating if they attend. Note: this doesn't just apply to food, so be sure to share donations from your florist, that amazing local gin company, or that party rental business your neighbor owns when they let you borrow their fog machine.\n\n\n\n17. You make this look good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news: you don't need to be a designer to make your social media promotional posts look great. There are plenty of free design tools out there to help you create polished, professional posts.&nbsp;Canva&nbsp;is a graphic design tool that takes all the guesswork out of creating beautiful designs, and they have lots of social media templates to choose from.&nbsp;Pixlr&nbsp;is an online photo editor with tons of effects to make your pictures look amazing. If you have something specific in mind, YouTube is your best friend, with countless tutorials for pretty much anything you can dream up.\n","date":"27 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/620525e30d63fd3f75cd1ce7_tips-to-sell-more-event-tickets-cover-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Thoughtful planning for a fundraiser can go a long way toward reaching your donation goals. To help you in your brainstorming sessions, we\u2019ve compiled 21 different fundraising event ideas that are sure to engage your community and help exceed your fundraising goals!\n\n\n\n1. Charity run\n\n\n\nProven successful time and time again, hosting a fun run is a classic fundraiser for charities! A walk-a-thon or 5K run are two simple and exciting ways to get your community to rally around your cause. Offer additional items like a free t-shirt or headband with your nonprofit\u2019s branding on them that participants can sport during your run. Looking to add a unique twist to your fundraising event idea? Try turning the event into a color run! For this, your runners will wear all white, then people on the sidelines will deck them out in colored powder as they run your course. Theme these colors to match your nonprofit\u2019s brand colors or the colors representing the issue your organization works with (like pink if your nonprofit fights against breast cancer). These runs are an energizing way to support your cause and bring together community members!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Outdoor festival\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no better way to successfully fundraise for your nonprofit than with a fun festival for all ages! Select a scenic outdoor venue for a day of food, drinks, and entertainment, themed in a way that\u2019s meaningful to your nonprofit community. For example, a conservation organization could throw a flower festival and celebrate in full bloom. Fire up some grills for your attendees, or partner with local restaurants or food trucks to donate their services for your festival in exchange for a sponsorship title and future collaboration opportunities. And what festival would be complete without fireworks, live music, or a DJ so people can dance the night away? As a final touch, request a fixed or pay-what-you-can admissions fee to kick off your fundraising campaign, then continue to collect donations throughout the night with raffles, games, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Dance marathon\n\n\n\nTime to put on your dancing shoes! A trending fundraiser among Millennials and Gen Z especially, dance marathons are an innovative opportunity for your community to support your nonprofit and really make a difference. A dance marathon typically encourages people to dance for between 24-48 hours straight (or until their team \u201cout dances\u201d the others). Before, during, and after the marathon, participants are tasked to find donors who\u2019ll pledge to donate based on their time and energy to dance for the cause. For this, have participants register and their donors give through your dance marathon\u2019s event page.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe marathon itself is a super energetic dance party with one primary rule: always stay moving! Deck out the dance floors with party lights, glow sticks, and anything else that could add to the vibe. To help pass the time with more than dancing, participants can also play games, put on talent shows, and do additional competitions to raise money. At the end of the marathon, celebrate with a huge reveal of how much money was collectively raised, and use this at your next fundraising event as the goal to beat!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. 50\/50 raffle\n\n\n\nA 50\/50 raffle is a simple yet exciting way to raise funds for your nonprofit while giving your supporters a chance to win big! Here\u2019s how it works: participants buy tickets to enter, and at the end of the raffle, half of the total cash pool goes to the lucky winner while the nonprofit keeps the other 50% to support its mission. Simply sell raffle tickets both online and at other fundraising events you're doing. Then, be sure to draw the winner in person at an event. This not only creates a fun, suspenseful moment but also increases the chances of the winner generously donating their 50% back to your cause. With the allure of a cash prize, 50\/50 raffles are a fantastic way to engage your community, raise funds quickly, and add an extra spark to any event!\n\n\n\n5. Charity concert\n\n\n\nBring your community together with live music, and jam out for a good cause! You can make the atmosphere of your concert as high-energy or relaxed as you want with your choice of venue, genre, and artist lineup. If you\u2019re looking to do more than a traditional concert, consider hosting a \u201cBattle of the Bands,\u201d a competition between local bands where a panel of judges and crowd participation determines the winner. After all, the more bands in your lineup, the more people will promote your concert and ultimately your cause. You could also sell tickets to a songwriters\u2019 round where local songwriters come to share their original songs, the stories behind their music, and what your nonprofit means to them. In addition to proceeds from your concert ticket sales, see if your guest artists would also be willing to donate a portion of their merch sales from the night to your cause.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Gala\n\n\n\nPlanning a formal evening is a perfect way to celebrate your charitable efforts at any time of year. Host a sit-down dinner at a beautiful venue where you could serve cocktails, have live music playing, and give attendees plenty of room to mingle. Pair your dinner with a live or silent auction of sponsored gifts from local businesses (like getaway packages, gift baskets, or signed memorabilia) to raise even more toward your goal. Build an eye-catching event listing (like on TicketLeap!) to sell tickets and to collect additional donations before the event even happens.\n\n\n\nTo motivate attendees, display a huge goal thermometer that tracks your fundraising efforts as the night progresses. Throughout your gala, invite relevant speakers to share motivational stories about how your nonprofit organization has impacted them. As a grand finale to your fundraising event, you can even host an awards ceremony to recognize notable members of your organization and in your community, giving back to people just as they\u2019ve given to your organization! To make sure the entire night runs flawlessly and maximize giving, use a ticketing platform to collect your general admissions fee, sell reserved tables for special guests, and collect additional donations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Golf tournament\n\n\n\nHost a friendly sports competition on a local golf course where the day\u2019s proceeds go directly to your nonprofit. Participants will pay to play for the day and compete as individuals or teams. To add to the stakes, get local businesses to sponsor the tournament\u2019s prizes (like athletic gear or gift cards) as well as the event itself. Once the golf tournament has ended and your winners have claimed their prizes, conclude the evening with a celebratory dinner alongside donors, tournament participants, and their families. Sell tickets to compete in your golf tournament, to attend the banquet, or both. With an exciting day planned to give back to your nonprofit, you\u2019re sure to score a hole-in-one with this fundraiser!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Limited-quantity raffle\n\n\n\nHosting a raffle with a limited number of ticket entries is a great way to get more people to buy in and help raise funds for your nonprofit! By capping the number of tickets sold \u2014 say, 100 raffle tickets at $20 \u2014 participants will each have a greater likelihood of potentially winning your prize, making them more eager to join in than if it was a raffle with hundreds of entrants. Think about it, if you raffle off a $500 Amazon gift card that someone donated to your cause and you sell up to 80 tickets for $25, you just raised $2,000! This approach not only will encourage supporters to enter, but it helps your organization hit its fundraising goal faster! You could do this as a stand-alone raffle fundraiser or as a part of other fundraising events you're hosting.\n\n\n\n9. Kid camps\n\n\n\nLooking for a surefire way to impact your community while also raising funds? Try hosting kid camps and youth programs! Imagine hosting a summer camp packed with excitement \u2014 educational workshops that teach STEM skills, sports activities that keep kids active, or arts and crafts sessions that get their creative juices flowing. By charging participation fees and recruiting a few volunteers to assist with the camp, your nonprofit can cover costs and raise money to support its mission. Plus, these programs often attract local sponsors who want to support such enriching experiences for kids. Whether it\u2019s a week-long day camp or just a weekend program, these events not only engage families but also spotlight your nonprofit\u2019s dedication to empowering the next generation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Educational workshops\n\n\n\nHosting educational workshops is an impactful way to raise funds while sharing your nonprofit's expertise with the community! Depending on your mission, the possibilities are endless. For example, an environmental nonprofit could hold workshops on sustainable gardening or upcycling household items, while an animal shelter might offer pet care tips or dog training classes. These events not only educate attendees but also draw in new supporters who are passionate about your cause. Charge a registration fee or solicit donations during the event to fund your programs. You could also livestream your classes to turn this into an online fundraising event and increase your donations! Once the session is over, don't forget to collect your participants' emails to get their feedback in a post-event survey and keep in touch about future events.\n\n\n\n11. Art auction\n\n\n\nAn art auction is a sophisticated yet engaging way to raise funds and bring your nonprofit\u2019s mission into the spotlight! Partner with talented local artists who are willing to donate their work, and consider inviting them to create pieces that align with your cause. These types of charity auctions could include paintings symbolizing environmental sustainability for a conservation nonprofit or bright portraits of hope benefiting a youth outreach program. Build anticipation by hosting a preview night, where attendees can experience the artwork up close while mingling over drinks and light refreshments. On the big night, you could opt for a silent auction where guests place their bids discreetly or go for the thrill of a live auction starring a charismatic auctioneer to keep the bids climbing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. One-for-one pledges\n\n\n\nOne-for-one pledges are a creative and impactful way to energize participants and maximize donations for your nonprofit! For activity-based fundraising events, consider peer-to-peer fundraising pledges like donating $10 for every lap skated at your roller rink fundraiser or $20 for every mile run during your charity race. This not only motivates participants but also ensures every step or lap goes towards your cause. Selling products? Add a pledge to donate one item for every item purchased \u2014 like giving a school supply kit to a child in need for each reusable water bottle sold. You can even get local businesses involved in one-for-one matching, such as a coffee shop donating one cup for every cup purchased during your event. These ideas create a tangible connection between the event and your mission while inspiring supporters to join in the fun and give generously!\n\n\n\n13. Local restaurant partnerships\n\n\n\nPartnering with local restaurants for special event nights is a win-win way for your organization and your community! Picture this: a local pizzeria agrees to share 20% of its profits from a \u201cCharity Pizza Night\u201d with your nonprofit, encouraging supporters to dine out in support. Or, a neighborhood caf\u00e9 hosts a \u201cCoffee for a Cause\u201d evening, where a dollar from every latte sold is donated to your organization. To spice the night up a little, restaurants can create a special menu item for the night \u2014 like a dessert named related to your mission \u2014 with a portion of proceeds going directly to your mission. In addition to helping generate revenue and bring in extra foot traffic for a local business, this is the perfect fundraising idea to rally your supporters to come together, enjoy great food, and make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Subscription boxes\n\n\n\nSelling subscription boxes can be a creative and consistent way to raise funds for your nonprofit while offering supporters something special to look forward to! As some examples, you could send monthly flower bouquet deliveries, hand-poured candles with unique scents or curated boxes of fresh, locally sourced produce. Focus on items tied to both your organization and the subscription's theme. Be sure to find ways to really think outside the box with this! Not only does this create a steady stream of income, but it\u2019s also a thoughtful gift idea that appeals to donors looking for meaningful ways to support a good cause.\n\n\n\n15. T-shirt design competition\n\n\n\nAs one of the best fundraising ideas for art lovers, encourage community members to flex their artistic skills by submitting unique t-shirt designs that reflect your cause. Charge an entrance fee for each submission, turning every entry into a direct contribution to your mission. Once the designs are in, encourage some healthy competition with a voting period (in-person or online) for the public to pick the winner. Use the winning design to create custom t-shirts you can sell at future events or through your website, and consider printing it on other branded merchandise like tote bags or mugs to expand your fundraiser\u2019s reach. Not only does this competition raise funds through entry fees and merchandise sales, but it also turns your supporters into ambassadors for your cause as they proudly wear or use the branded items, spreading awareness everywhere they go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Social media challenges\n\n\n\nEmbrace the power of social media to rally support, raise funds, and spread awareness for your nonprofit! Think about challenges that align with your mission, like a fitness challenge where participants pledge to walk or run a certain number of miles, a creative art challenge to design something inspired by your cause, or a storytelling challenge where supporters share how your organization has personally impacted them. Create a catchy, unique hashtag to unify your posts (e.g., #ArtForImpact) and make it easier to track the challenge's participation. Whether it's Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or another platform, encourage participants across the web to share their personal experiences and tag friends, helping to generate a ripple effect of awareness and peer-to-peer fundraising to your donation page.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n17. Paint and sip\n\n\n\nLooking for a fun and social way to raise money for your nonprofit? Hosting a paint and sip event might be just the thing! Set up at a cozy venue \u2014 maybe a local winery, art studio, or a community center \u2014 and provide all the materials your guests need, like canvases, brushes, and paints. Have a local artist lead the session with a specific theme or let your attendees get creative with a blank canvas. Pair this fundraising activity with a selection of beverages to keep it relaxed and enjoyable. Sell tickets ahead of time and add a donation option on your fundraising page for those who want to give extra support. To build a buzz around this fundraising campaign, promote this event to local art communities, post about it across social media, and tap into your email list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Virtual events\n\n\n\nConnect with potential donors across the globe like never before and drive more support for your organization with virtual events. The possibilities for your online fundraising events are endless! Consider hosting a virtual conference or workshop to inform people about your cause. You could also try a series of webinars with leaders in your community and individuals impacted by the work you do. Arrange an entertaining evening for the whole family, like a trivia night complete with a MC and prizes. Live-streaming your events on TikTok and other social platforms is also a powerful way to share more about your cause with people. You should even consider hosting hybrid fundraising events to get even more people involved both in person and virtually!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Give-It-Up challenge\n\n\n\nA \"Give-It-Up\" challenge is a creative and personal way to inspire supporters to raise money for your nonprofit while making small sacrifices for a big impact! Ask participants to give up a habit (like skipping their daily lattes, eating out, or buying snacks) for a set time, such as a week or month, and to donate the money they save during that period. Organize the challenge by creating an easy-to-use registration page where participants can sign up, track their progress, and make their donations. Use social media to promote the event, share tips for sticking to their goals, and feature stories from participants of the challenge. To boost engagement, offer incentives like public shoutouts, small prizes, or certificates of completion for those who hit their donation goals. By the end, your participants will feel fulfilled for supporting your cause by letting go of a habit!\n\n\n\n20. Cake walk\n\n\n\nWant to take your traditional bake sale fundraising idea up a notch? Host a cake walk! It's a sweet and simple way to bring your community together while raising funds for your nonprofit. To get started, select a venue like a school gym, park pavilion, or community center, and decorate it to create a welcoming atmosphere. Gather an assortment of cakes donated by local bakeries, volunteers, or supporters \u2014 anything from Bundt cakes to cupcakes will work! Set up a circle with numbered spots and play lively music as participants walk around; when the music stops, you draw a number, and whoever is standing on that number wins a cake. Sell tickets online to join the rounds and sell other baked goods onsite too for additional funds. On top of supporting your nonprofit, attendees will love the chance to win a delicious homemade treat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21. Murder mystery dinner\n\n\n\nTurn a night of sleuthing into a powerful fundraiser for your nonprofit with a murder mystery dinner! As a fitting fundraising event around Halloween especially, start by picking an exciting theme \u2014 like \"1920s Speakeasy\" or \"Haunted Mansion\" \u2014 and secure a venue that sets the scene, such as a banquet hall or even a community center transformed to match your story\u2019s backdrop. Sell tickets to the dinner and show experience, design a themed menu, and offer opportunities for additional donations throughout the night (e.g., a raffle or a silent auction). Recruit volunteers or local actors to play the roles and guide the storyline, or if your organization is a theater or another performing arts organization, cast the talented performers you already have! It\u2019s a great way to excite and entertain, while bringing attention to your nonprofit\u2019s cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaise money like never before at your next fundraising event\n\n\n\nWith a solid fundraising goal and an exciting event, you\u2019re bound to raise more funds for your nonprofit organization than ever before.

Hosting awesome events throughout the school year can help you meet your online fundraising goals and give your high school students creative opportunities to make memories they'll be telling their own kids about! Here are a few of our favorite fundraising ideas for high schools that are sure to be a hit!\n\n\n\n1. Themed dances\n\n\n\nHomecoming and prom are always the most anticipated events of any school year, so boost the excitement all year long by throwing some extra themed school dances as fundraising events in between! Plus, who doesn't like an excuse to dress up? You can theme these dances around holidays (Christmas, Valentine's Day, etc.), the seasons (like a spring formal or a fall barn dance), or other ideas that make your students want to throw on their dancing shoes. Deck out your school gym based on your theme, crank up the music, and dance the night away! Want to add a little extra to your fundraising total? In addition to selling tickets for these dances, consider selling concessions like soda and snacks throughout the night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Annoying song challenge\n\n\n\nLooking for a hilariously creative way to fundraise? Try the \"Annoying Song Challenge\" as found on TikTok! Here\u2019s how it works: pick a song that\u2019s guaranteed to get stuck in everyone\u2019s head \u2014 think something silly, repetitive, and just a little bit obnoxious. Then, play it on repeat between class periods, making it the unavoidable anthem of the hallways. The twist? Students, teachers, and staff can donate to make the music stop! Set a fundraising goal, and once it\u2019s reached, free the school from its musical torment. It\u2019s a laugh-out-loud way to raise money while uniting everyone in a shared mission to end the madness. Plus, it\u2019s bound to be a memory they\u2019ll talk about for years, all while supporting a meaningful cause!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Showcases\n\n\n\nYour school community is packed with untapped creative potential! Hosting a showcase gives students the perfect way to share their talents (in music, art, acting, fashion \u2013 you name it!) with the community members of the school. To boost your ticket sales and your fundraising efforts, consider requesting a \u201cpay what you can\u201d admission fee as well as selling popcorn and other small concessions at the door. Really want to sweeten the deal and encourage some friendly competition? Put together a gift card, cash prize, or exclusive school incentive like a \u201cget out of class early\u201d ticket for the best in each category. To amp up the excitement even more, like your own America's Got Talent, have a panel of teachers judge and pick the winners. Who knows, some of those students might become famous one day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Restaurant nights\n\n\n\nPartner with a local restaurant to host a fundraising night where a percentage of the profits are donated to your school. Then, spread the word and pack the place with students, their families, and their friends to all share a meal together. Be sure to pick a restaurant your student body already loves to go to or has always wanted to try! If you can't settle on just one, partner with food or ice cream trucks to come to your school and share the profits of the school fundraiser that way. Students will enjoy getting to skip the cafeteria food and support their school in the process of raising money!\n\n\n\n5. Color runs\n\n\n\nMore than just a typical run, a color run encourages all participating students to wear all white clothes (and maybe some sunglasses) while they run a 5K. Fans on the sidelines throw colored powder at them as they go past, and by the end, they'll be decked out in a super cool array of colors and have some Instagram-worthy photos to share! These color runs are much less competitive, walk-friendly, and more appealing to younger audiences, making it a perfect event for your high school. Through your event's ticketing page, you can charge an entry fee, sell school T-shirts and invite students to wear during the run, ask for additional donations, or even sell the chance to throw some extra colored powder at people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Half-time competitions\n\n\n\nAs students have fun cheering on their school's teams against their biggest rivals, try adding to the fun with crowd games that will really make them go wild (and help you raise funds). For example, set up a \u201cGoal Shot\u201d game where people pay to take a shot at halftime for a chance to win prizes. You can also host a raffle, spin-to-win game, relay race, or other fun contests on the playing field to encourage students to help score those fundraising goals for your school.\n\n\n\n7. Penny wars\n\n\n\nGet ready to spark some excitement with a penny war fundraiser! Here\u2019s how it works: each class gets a giant jug to decorate and display in a prominent place at your school. Students then bring in as many pennies as they can find \u2014 anything from rolls of pennies to loose change from piggy banks and couch cushions \u2014 all in an effort to fill their jug to the brim! The class with the heaviest jug of pennies wins a prize, like a pizza party, an ice cream social, or even an extended lunch break to celebrate their teamwork. This idea pairs friendly competition with community giving, inspiring students, teachers, and families to come together for a great cause. Plus, those small contributions really add up \u2014 you\u2019ll be amazed at how fast those pennies turn into substantial funds for your school!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Silent auctions\n\n\n\nSilent auctions are a classic school fundraising event that students and parents alike love. Essentially, people donate items or experiences that the audience will then bid on. And the opportunities are endless! For parents, offer things that'll make their lives or their children's lives easier, like reserved parking spots at games or date night packages. If one of your high school sports' teams is willing to help, offer to \u201crent the team\u201d for a day to do lawn work, rake leaves, or shovel snow. For students, auction off perks like off-site lunch privileges or prime designated parking spots. Then sit back and watch the funds roll in!\n\n\n\n9. Carnival nights\n\n\n\nThrow a carnival in your school's parking lot and get ready for a full weekend of fun! Sell wristbands at the door and let your students, their families, and the local community enjoy thrilling rides like the Merry-Go-Round, Gravitron, Zipper, and so much more. Sell classic carnival food like cotton candy or hot dogs to really sell the experience, pay to play games and win prizes, or even sell the chance to dunk teachers in a dunk tank!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Prom potty\n\n\n\nLooking to add some viral flair to your next school fundraiser? The \"Prom Potty\" fundraiser, inspired by this viral video on TikTok, is an absolute riot! For this fundraising idea, students take an old toilet, beat it up, and go all out decorating it with paint, glitter, or goofy designs. Then, this porcelain masterpiece gets placed in someone\u2019s front yard until that homeowner donates to have it removed or pay a bit more to send it to another person\u2019s yard of their choosing. Want to guarantee your yard stays toilet free? Donate a certain amount (e.g., $100) to keep it off your lawn. This hilarious fundraiser not only creates unforgettable memories but also brings the community together in good spirits! Be sure to have a team of volunteers ready to move the potty from house to house, and don\u2019t forget to add a sign explaining your mission to anyone driving by. Whether you\u2019re raising money for prom or another project for the school, the \"Prom Potty\" is bound to make everyone laugh, while racking up plenty of funds!\n\n\n\n11. Community yard sale\n\n\n\nOrganizing a yard sale not only provides an opportunity for your school to raise funds but also cultivates a greater sense of school spirit among students, parents, and your local community. To start, encourage students\u2019 families and your community to donate gently used items for the school to sell. Volunteers from your school community can contribute their time to sort, price, and organize the items for the sale too. Then, promote the school fundraising event through social media, local news stations, and community bulletin boards, to attract a wide audience. Not only will you earn additional funds to support your school\u2019s efforts, people will get deals on some awesome new items in the process!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Teacher challenges\n\n\n\nBuild a buzz around the school that the principal will do something crazy if the school can raise a certain amount and get students excited to donate to make it happen. Get their favorite teachers, the theater director, the PE instructor, or other daring faculty in on the stunt as well! Based on successful ideas used by other schools, you can cover them in slime or silly string, stick them to the wall with tape, throw pies in their faces, or even have them do the chicken dance while wearing a chicken costume.\n\n\n\n13. No fuss fundraiser\n\n\n\nFor a low-effort, high-impact fundraiser, try a \"No Fuss Fundraiser\"! As a popular idea shared on TikTok, simply send students home with a form labeled \"No Fuss Fundraiser,\" presenting parents with a humorous breakdown of donation options. For example, \u201cDonate $25 since it\u2019s what you would\u2019ve spent on baking cupcakes for a bake sale anyway!\u201d or \u201cContribute $50 to skip signing up for a walkathon and getting a free t-shirt.\u201d It\u2019s a clever and time-saving way to directly support the school while giving busy parents a laugh. While some families may really appreciate this simple approach to fundraising, don\u2019t forget to mix in those classic high school fundraising ideas as well. Traditional fundraising events not only help raise money but also create incredible memories for students and their families!\n\n\n\nTry out our creative fundraising ideas for high schools!\n\n\n\nAs you begin to put your favorite fundraising ideas into action, consider using an event ticketing platform to streamline your fundraising efforts.

Whether it's for selling concessions or running a lighting board and sound system, building a committed and capable team will make a huge difference for your event.\n\n\n\nRead on for five key considerations to keep in mind when hiring event staff so you can make sure everything goes off without a hitch!\n\n\n\n1. Brush up on local regulations\n\n\n\nBefore you begin to hire event staff, be sure to check out the legal requirements for events in your area. A quick Google search for regulations in your state will help you get to know the rules about staffing for events. For example, you may need to obtain permits or licenses to sell alcohol, host live music, or use certain venues. You also may need liability insurance to protect yourself, attendees, and staff in case of accidents. We recommend having a signed contract with each member of your staff to make sure they know exactly what they\u2019re signing up to do and what your expectations are. Plus, being transparent builds trust and helps maintain positive relationships with your event staff!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Know the roles you need\n\n\n\nDepending on the experience you\u2019re hosting, you\u2019ll probably need a wide variety of event staff on the books. Here are a few examples of common event staffing needs:\n\n\n\nSecurity&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs one of the key elements of your onsite strategy, having security measures in place ensures everyone who attends feels safe and secure. It also helps prevent incidents and protects the liability of clients and event organizers.\n\n\n\nEvent production&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYour production crew is the unsung hero of any event, working behind the scenes to manage sound, lighting, and any other technical aspects to make the event successful and ensure everything runs smoothly. This should be one of your first hires!\n\n\n\nRegistration and check-in\n\n\n\nYour attendees will likely all arrive around the same time, so it\u2019s a good idea to station some staff members at each entrance to check them in, and station some to manage the box office for those buying tickets at the door. Bonus tip: ask your sponsors to send some swag or postcards for you to give away at registration, so their brand is the first thing attendees see!\n\n\n\nEvent set up and tear down\n\n\n\nHaving a dedicated team for this task will ensure everything looks perfect before the event starts and is cleaned up afterwards. Create a list of all the needed tasks for the head of this team to delegate, taking some responsibilities off your plate.\n\n\n\nRefreshments\n\n\n\nDepending on the size of your event, you may need to hire people to sell concessions. If you\u2019re offering a buffet, stations, or a sit-down dinner, consider hiring a catering team to cook the food for you as well as help set up, serve, and tear down afterwards.\n\n\n\nPhotography and videography\n\n\n\nHaving designated staff grabbing stellar photos and videos for your event will ensure you have professional photos for your social media posts, promo for future events, press releases, and sponsorship proposals. If this isn\u2019t in your budget just yet, check out our event photography guide to learn how to take awesome photos yourself!\n\n\n\nChild assistance\n\n\n\nChild care can help make the event enjoyable for both parents and children by keeping kids entertained with fun activities like making crafts or watching a movie. Depending on the number of attendees using this service, you might even consider dividing this by different age groups with different activities.\n\n\n\nVolunteers\n\n\n\nVolunteers help reduce costs and maximize resources while fostering a community-oriented spirit at the event! Their onsite responsibilities can range from helping with check-in, to handing out free T-shirts, to selling snacks. In exchange for their time, they are usually happy to be compensated with access to your event.\n\n\n\n3. Consider your event budget&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHaving a team full of the best staff available is the goal, and you need to carefully budget to make sure you can afford everyone\u2019s wages alongside all other aspects of your event. Now, you might be wondering, how much do event staff get paid? Your staff members\u2019 rates will depend on a few factors, like what you need them to do and how much expertise they have. Research the pay rates for similar staff positions at other events to ensure you\u2019re offering a competitive rate and planning your budget accordingly. It also depends on the nature of the job. For example, a catering or a production team may have a predetermined rate for their services, while you may set the hourly rate or a set dollar figure for your check-in staff.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4. Recruit for your staff positions\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve determined what roles your event needs, it\u2019s time to get the word out there and find quality candidates! Post a job offer on hiring sites like ZipRecruiter, Simply Hired, or Idealist, as many contractors and freelancers turn there first for job opportunities. Be descriptive with your post and include your pay range, needed qualifications, and expected responsibilities to reach the right candidates. For positions requiring specific experience or skill sets, you could also partner with a staffing agency, as they have access to a larger pool of potential applicants and have worked with other event planners.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Interview and hire your team!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast but not least, it\u2019s time to interview your applicants and finalize your onsite crew. Remember that when you\u2019re choosing who will be a part of your team, even for a day, you need to pick those who have the skills you need and whose vision aligns with yours. And that starts with asking the right questions. They\u2019ll vary depending on the position (i.e., if it\u2019s focused more on soft skills like customer service or technical skills like photography). Here are a few examples to help you get started:\n\n\n\n\nTell me about a time when you worked on a project that required you to work both independently and as a team?\n\n\n\nDo you have experience using event ticketing software?\n\n\n\nHow have you dealt with unexpected situations while onsite?\n\n\n\nDescribe your previous experience working with events similar to ours.\n\n\n\n\nWhen setting up the interview, pick a medium that works best for you. In-person or remote interviews, one-on-ones or in a group, and one-off meetings or multi-round sessions are all decisions you\u2019ll need to make based on the scope of your needs. The key is to find an approach that supports your organization and helps you build a strong team. Once you\u2019re done interviewing and selecting staff, give your newest team members a warm welcome just in time for your next event!\n\n\n\nNow that you know what goes into hiring event staff, be sure you have the right ticketing partner by your side! With an easy-to-use ticketing system like TicketLeap, you\u2019ll gain a friendly support team and a full set of features to cover your every need.\n","date":"16 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6446ac48c12607ecdb5af7fa_two-staff-members-hanging-a-painting-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

Thrill-seekers are dying to test their bravery at your haunted house, hayride, or maze, so you need to make the most of that excitement by promoting your event to as many potential customers as possible. Dive into our team's online marketing tips and tricks that are sure to help you drive more revenue, get your event in front of more audiences, and keep your attendees coming back again and again to experience the thrilling terror of the season!\n\n\n\nWhat is event marketing?\n\n\n\nBefore we dive in: what is event marketing, and how can it help your haunted attraction? It's simple! Event marketing is how you promote your haunt and can range from asking your friends and family to spread the word, to posting on social media, to developing a multi-pronged digital marketing campaign. To put it in layman's terms, it's an opportunity to connect with potential attendees in a way that makes sense for your business. Building a quality marketing strategy is a key step in your overall success!\n\n\n\nPlanning for success with KPIs\n\n\n\nBefore getting into the weeds on how to market your most terrifying haunt yet, it's vital to have attainable goals on your event's overall performance that are specific to you. Then, you can set benchmarks along the way to measure whether you're making good progress towards your goals or not. These smaller milestones are called key performance indicators (or KPIs, for short). As your team markets your haunted attraction, use those KPIs to gauge the success of your efforts. While the season goes on, you can assess your data and adjust your marketing strategies accordingly. Here's a few examples of KPIs that could benefit your haunted attraction:\n\n\n\n\u200dNumber of tickets sold\n\n\n\nThe number of tickets you sell is directly tied to your overall revenue and how many attendees you can expect on the big day, so it's a great way to&nbsp;measure the success of your haunt! Start selling tickets early so you have plenty of time to reach as many potential buyers as possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u200dRevenue\n\n\n\nYour haunt has multiple revenue streams coming in such as ticket sales, merchandise, and additional onsite experiences. Review what has historically been the most popular, and try to determine why. You can adjust your marketing efforts to showcase your staple haunted attractions, or bring more awareness to experiences that attendees may not know about.\n\n\n\n\u200dNumber of event check-ins\n\n\n\nSometimes, the number of event check-ins can be even more important than the number of tickets sold. If you notice a large number of people are buying tickets but not showing up, you might want to adjust your marketing efforts to keep people hyped up between the time they buy their tickets and finally enter your haunt.\n\n\n\n\u200dAttendee engagement\n\n\n\nKeep an eye on the number of shares, likes, or mentions your event gets on social media, and which types of posts perform the best. If you're&nbsp;sending email campaigns, note how many opens and clicks you get, and be sure to track which email is getting the most people to buy tickets.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttendee experience\n\n\n\nGauge your attendees' opinions of your attractions with in-checkout questionnaires and post-event surveys. Customize your questions to discover how they found your event, how scary their experience was, and how to make your haunted house even better next Halloween!\n\n\n\n\u200dEvent marketing strategies to drive more revenue\n\n\n\nSell online tickets on a branded event page\n\n\n\nFirst thing's first: you need an eye-catching, easy-to-navigate event ticketing page to link to from your marketing campaigns. You want your event page to look like an extension of your brand and have an easy purchase flow, so it's important to work with an online ticketing system that can tailor everything to your liking. Bonus points if they offer professional-looking templates to help get you started, or put the power in your hands to build a fully branded event page from scratch that looks great on both desktop and mobile. Be sure to highlight all the most important aspects of your event, including the dates and times, where it's located, the best aspects of your experience, and any other additional information your attendees should know before they arrive, like parking info.\n\n\n\nSend targeted email blasts\n\n\n\nA great place to start with sending email campaigns is to target your attendees from past years. You already know this audience has an interest in your haunt, so now you can wow them with all the new thrills you're going to have this year. Consider using discount codes to get them to buy now. Send a 10% off discount code if customers purchase their tickets by a certain date to incentivize an early sale. Or capitalize on your attendees' social circle by offering a friends and family discount, like 15% off when they buy four or more tickets. \u200d For the most successful email campaigns possible, be sure to follow these tips:\n\n\n\n\nInclude an attention-grabbing subject line that stands out in the inbox - emojis encouraged! (e.g., It's Aliiiive!&nbsp;\ud83e\udddf This Year's Haunt is Here!)\n\n\n\nMake use of your preheader text to expand on your subject line (e.g., Casper's Haunted House is back and bigger than ever! Get your tickets today!)\n\n\n\nPersonalize your emails by using dynamic content to add your recipients' names either in the subject line or in the body of your email\n\n\n\nAdd a terrifying image of your haunted house to get your audience hyped up\n\n\n\nAdd details about your event, like where and when it is and a description of what to do there\n\n\n\nAdd a clear call to action to buy tickets now and link to your event listing\n\n\n\n\nLastly, be sure to check if you can send out free email campaigns directly from your ticketing system. Not only will it help keep costs down, but your ticket buyer information will already be stored there, so it'll make segmenting your customers and building branded emails a snap!\n\n\n\nSpread the holiday fear on social media\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to scaring up interest in your haunt, never underestimate the power of social media! All year long, and especially during haunt season, you should be posting regularly on your&nbsp;Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media profiles so you can engage with your fans and connect with new audiences. No matter what platforms you advertise on, your haunt's social media marketing presence should be focused on giving audiences a taste of the thrills and chills they can expect to see at your event (and encouraging them to buy tickets right away, of course!).\n\n\n\nPost&nbsp;high-quality video and photos, and keep your captions short and to the point. Grab readers' attention fast and always end with a direct call to action, like&nbsp;\u201cGet your tickets while they last!\u201d&nbsp;After your customers purchase tickets, you can keep the engagement going and even turn them into free brand ambassadors by inviting them to share your event to their own social profiles! \u200d To get the most out of your social media campaigns, try out these tips and tricks:\n\n\n\nStay active\n\n\n\nPost at least once a day and aim for 7-10 posts per week leading up to your event.\n\n\n\nQuality over quantity\n\n\n\nPost content that is super interesting and helpful to your followers. Spread the word about your event and promotions, and also highlight your community and give shoutouts to fans.\n\n\n\nCreate event hashtags\n\n\n\nHashtags are a fun tool for getting discovered by new audiences. Use 1-3 hashtags per post, including a brand-specific hashtag. That way, each platform will&nbsp;serve up your posts in search results, making it easier for you to #SpreadTheHolidayFear\n\n\n\nInvite people to follow\n\n\n\nDirectly invite your friends and those interested in your haunt to follow you right from an action on your Facebook Page!\n\n\n\nInclude your Facebook and Instagram handle on everything (and we mean everything)\n\n\n\nThe more places your social media handles appear, the more opportunities there are for people to follow. Include your handle on all your online posts, printed materials, and offline advertising campaigns.\n\n\n\nDesign Facebook and Instagram posts to generate followers\n\n\n\nInclude calls to action in the post text, like,&nbsp;\u201cTag the friend you'd want to be stuck in a zombie apocalypse with!\u201d\n\n\n\nEngage with existing communities and follow relevant accounts\n\n\n\nUse Instagram Search to find hashtags, geotags, and handles of people who are in your area. Get involved by liking, sharing, and commenting on their content! Many people will return the favor and follow you if they like what they see.\n\n\n\nRegularly post video content\n\n\n\nPost videos on TikTok\u00a0and Instagram to take advantage of their massive Gen Z user base to reach a younger demographic and find new repeat customers for years to come. Take your followers through parts of your haunted house, introduce them to artists, show time lapses of setup, and more. In the lead-up to opening day, post content of behind-the-scenes tours to get people excited to see your haunt.\n\n\n\nShare user-generated content\n\n\n\nWhile at your event, encourage attendees to post from your haunt using your custom hashtag (exp: #HauntedHillsManor). Whenever you need content, simply search your hashtag on Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram, and look for smiling faces enjoying your experience and re-share their posts on your profile!\n\n\n\nCreate special promotions for your haunted attraction\n\n\n\nThe key to a good haunted attraction advertising campaign is keeping the focus local. Start by making a list of news outlets, online magazines, blogs, and other locally-targeted, high-traffic websites you want to purchase online ad placements from. A lot of these outlets offer banner ad placements, in-article ads, and even paid inclusion in their email newsletters, which will get your haunted attraction in front of thousands of potential customers. (Pro tip: make the most of these placements by offering a small discount to those who purchase tickets right away!)\n\n\n\nYour local community is the perfect audience for some offline engagement, too! Classic marketing tactics like flyers, print magazine and newspaper ads, and even billboards are tried and true ways to drive more ticket sales. For example, consider partnering with local restaurants, retailers, and grocery stores to pass out discount coupons for your haunted attraction to their customers. A partnership with local businesses might be just what you need to give your ticket sales that extra little boost. \u200dBeyond these more \u201ctraditional\u201d routes, you should also consider the benefits of influencer marketing. Scope out local personalities and social media influencers with a devoted following, and work with them to&nbsp;arrange a partnership. You might even find that influencer marketing can be more affordable and much more powerful in reaching new audiences than other paid advertising methods!\n\n\n\nTrack discounts, promotions, and special pricing\n\n\n\nOffering&nbsp;exclusive discounts&nbsp;to specific audiences is a sure-fire way to boost ticket sales. Encourage attendees to buy early with early-bird discounts. Offer special group rates for families and friends to attend together for less. Create a loyalty program to reward recurring thrill-seekers and keep them coming back throughout the season. You can even sell tickets to VIP experiences or speed passes to skip the lines for all your haunted attractions! No matter how you offer specially priced event tickets, ensure you're tracking your efforts. Attach unique tracking parameters on the links to your event page for each promotion or discount code to determine exactly where your ticket sales are coming from.\n\n\n\nGet the word out with online paid advertising\n\n\n\nPaid social advertising\n\n\n\nDepending on your budget, interest targeting on Facebook is a great way to increase awareness, gain new followers, and sell out tickets to your haunted attraction. Facebook Ads Manager provides a bunch of ways to target potential customers across both Facebook and Instagram. When it comes to interest targeting, a user's \u201cinterests\u201d are based on what they share on their timelines, the apps they use, the ads they click, the pages they like, and more. That means you should target your ads to interests relevant to your haunt, like&nbsp;other haunted attractions and events, horror films, and Halloween in general.\n\n\n\nYou may also want to explore&nbsp;Lookalike Audiences&nbsp;to unlock a new audience and grow your brand awareness even more after you've collected enough purchase data. Lookalike Audiences are created from a source audience of already existing customers. Facebook then identifies common characteristics and creates a new audience that mirrors the source. Basically, that means all the heavy lifting is done for you, and you reap the rewards! \n\n\n\nImportant note: you're most likely reaching a new audience who may not have heard of your haunted attraction before, so make sure your text is friendly, informative, and sufficiently spooky. Include your haunt's details, location, run time, and a fun call-to-action to purchase tickets alongside the \u201cBook Now\u201d button. For your ad creative, test between static images, short videos, and carousel ads to see what your audience likes best. Select the most thrilling photos of your event to stop people in their tracks as they're scrolling. Remember, this is a new audience, so you want to feature the most popular aspects of your haunted attraction!\u200d\n\n\n\nSocial media remarketing\n\n\n\nDid you know you could specifically target website visitors who checked out your haunted house but haven't purchased a ticket yet? Remarketing helps you zero in on people who have shown interest, but haven't quite sealed the deal. Since they've already engaged with your website, these users are way more likely to place an order, so it's usually more efficient to re-target them again than start a new, broader campaign.\n\n\n\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are great places to run remarketing campaigns because that's where your customers already spend a lot of their time. If you have customer lists from previous years, it's also a good idea to remarket to them. Uploading a list of email addresses and other contact information to Facebook lets you target those specific users with your social media ads.\n\n\n\nWell-timed, targeted, and interesting remarketing ads can easily be the most effective part of your social media marketing toolkit! \u200d For remarketing ads, use reminder language to get them to buy tickets, while also adding new information about your haunt, featuring a testimonial from a recent visitor or influencer, or highlighting a part of your event they might not already be aware of. Create a sense of urgency to get customers to buy tickets right away (e.g., \u201cHalloween is approaching - don't miss out on the fun of spooky season!\u201d). Offering a discount to these audiences is another great motivator, like 20% of children's tickets or free parking. Sometimes the opportunity to save a few bucks is all it takes!\n\n\n\nStart working with a free, user-friendly ticketing system\n\n\n\nWhile it's possible to create a successful, multi-pronged marketing strategy on your own, using an event ticketing and management system sure does make it a whole lot easier!

Compile the stats\n\n\n\nPut together a&nbsp;sponsorship deck&nbsp;or document to highlight your attendee demographics as well as your various offerings (we'll get to this in a moment). Be sure to include your event's expected attendance and your average traffic to your social media, website, and newsletters. Thanks to these hard numbers, you'll present a more compelling pitch to your potential sponsors by showing how much exposure they'll receive and how many new leads they could gain by partnering with you.\n\n\n\n3. Put together your list of potential sponsors\n\n\n\nThink about what kinds of companies would want to connect with your audience. If you have a niche audience, look for companies that match those interests (like an indie artist partnering with a local radio station for their concert). If you have a larger audience with a wide range of interests, focus on organizations that are looking for brand awareness and want to promote heavily. Local businesses like restaurants and utility companies can be a great fit here. As a rule of thumb, smaller events are the perfect outlet for small business partnerships, while larger events may be better suited for corporate sponsors.\n\n\n\na. Use your network\n\n\n\nIncrease your odds of getting sponsorships by starting with the people on your list who you already know. An established relationship can go a long way towards getting a yes. If you get a no, that's alright! Use it as an opportunity to get feedback on how you can be more appealing to sponsors, increasing your success with future pitches.\n\n\n\nb. Pinpoint your community's heavy hitters\n\n\n\nResearch organizations that are popular locally and actively promoting themselves. You could also investigate who tends to sponsor other events in your area, or even visit their vendor booths yourself at other local events like festivals, fairs, or conventions. That way, you can network with potential sponsors in person, so when you reach out to them later, they'll remember your conversation!\n\n\n\nc. Find sponsors online\n\n\n\nDon't underestimate the power of a simple Google search! By doing so, you can easily target organizations that align with your mission. You can see what events they might already be sponsoring and who to contact about sponsoring yours. Plus, you may come across partnership suggestions that you might not have come up with yourself.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of sponsorships you should offer\n\n\n\nWant to know how to get sponsors for an event? It's no secret \u2013 offer irresistible sponsorship packages! For example, if you're hosting a beverage festival, giving a local brewery the chance to show off their latest brew is a match made in heaven. By showing prospects that you've done your homework and already have effective sponsorship ideas lined up, you'll gain their confidence and land some awesome deals!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpecific sponsorship placements\n\n\n\nThink about your event's unique experiences and how you can incorporate potential sponsors into them in a natural way. Consider giving them a booth onsite to interact with attendees, collect their contact info, and turn them into future customers. Use their company's name and logo across your event's signage and promotional materials to increase brand visibility. You could also use their logo on merchandise, drinking cups, handheld fans, or even a photo booth with the sponsor's name printed out on the photo.\n\n\n\nConsider what your attendees may really want too! Branded art installations, sponsored cooling stations on a hot summer day, or a meal provided by your sponsor are sure hits, leaving attendees with a positive impression of your sponsor's brand.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTiered sponsorships\n\n\n\nWith&nbsp;tiered sponsorships, your sponsor can determine what price suits them and, in exchange, how much their brand is used throughout the event. A lower tier might offer brand placements in your newsletters and promotional materials or a shoutout on social media. With higher tiers comes greater visibility, like sponsoring a happy hour or your performance lineup, and potentially even a title sponsorship, if they want to go all out for your event!\n\n\n\nNon-monetary sponsorships\n\n\n\nWhile sponsorships typically involve money, they might offer other resources or perks instead in exchange for exposure at your event. If you're in need of a caterer, consider finding a local food truck to feed your attendees in exchange for free event promotion. Work with a local radio station to help spread word about your event in exchange for a booth at your venue. The recipe for the perfect sponsorship is one that lets you use each others' strengths and meet each other's needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to approach sponsors\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to find sponsors for an event as amazing as yours, how do you convince them to partner with you? One of the trickiest parts of landing sponsorships is figuring out the best way to approach potential partners. An email is a great way to start the conversation, but you'll need to go the extra mile to make sure yours is at the top of their inbox (especially because business owners and other decision makers often get tons of requests and pitches). Here are some questions to consider so you can cut through the noise and get the response you're looking for:\n\n\n\n\nWho?&nbsp;\u2013 At large companies, it's often the marketing team who makes the decisions about sponsorships, so contact them directly. In the case of smaller businesses, you'll want to reach out to the owner or general manager.\n\n\n\nWhat?&nbsp;\u2013 Give a brief description of your event (including the planned date and location) and its goals.\n\n\n\nWhy?&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;This is the most important part of your email. Tell them why they should sponsor your event. This initial email is not the place to focus on yourself or a specific dollar amount, but rather what your prospective sponsor will be getting out of the partnership. Be as specific as possible about what you can deliver.\n\n\n\nHow?&nbsp;\u2013 Show the organization that you've chosen them for a reason and that you have a solid understanding of what they do. Give them a taste of the ideas you have in mind for this partnership and they'll see that you've put some thought into your decision to reach out to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep your letter short and sweet, including only the most important details. That way, you'll have more luck in getting sponsors for your event to read your entire email. Also, consider your audience when determining the tone of your email. You want to be polite and friendly, but there's no need to be overly formal \u2014 especially if you're reaching out to someone you already know.\n\n\n\nStarting a relationship with your sponsor\n\n\n\nYou emailed everyone on your list and all that hard work paid off \u2014 you got a response! Now it's time to grow that relationship. If possible, try to meet with them face-to-face, ideally in person or through a video call. To help ensure this meeting is a success, prepare the pitch for your&nbsp;sponsorship proposal&nbsp;as well as your answers to anticipated questions about it. This might include pricing options, event logistics about where their logo and name will be seen, or how the sponsor will benefit from working with your event. Having an&nbsp;event day checklist&nbsp;can make this discussion easier as well. To help, here are the top questions your sponsors will want answered:\n\n\n\nWhat is the cost per reach? (And what does that mean?)\n\n\n\n\u200dThe total cost of sponsoring your event is important, but sponsors are more interested in how much they are paying per attendee. The more aligned your attendees are with their target demographic, the more potential sponsors will be willing to spend.\n\n\n\nWhat are the additional costs in sponsoring your event?\n\n\n\nTo make the most out of this partnership, sponsors need to spend more than just the check they write to your event. When sponsors spend money on independently promoting and marketing sponsorships, that's called sponsorship activation. This includes finding\u00a0PR opportunities\u00a0before the event,\u00a0giving out swag, displaying banners at the event, and building a booth. Showing that you're aware of these activation costs is reassuring to sponsors.\n\n\n\nDoes your event match their company's core values?\n\n\n\nOne of a business owner's priorities is to uphold their company's values and ensure their partners do the same. This sponsorship proposal is your chance to demonstrate how your organization's unique story aligns with those values and how your audience matches their target market.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAre there any indirect benefits?\n\n\n\nIf a company sponsors your event, consider offering some added bonuses in return for helping you. For example, you could give away free tickets or backstage passes to meet your performers or celebrity guests. They could pass these perks onto their VIP clients too, extending the effectiveness of their sponsorship.\n\n\n\nMaking those relationships last\n\n\n\nOnce you've scored your sponsorships (congrats!) and your event has come and gone, sponsors will be thinking about how beneficial their partnership with you was, and whether they'd like to invest more in the future. Did you give them what you promised? Did they gain contacts of potential new customers thanks to your event? Did you follow up with them right after the event?\n\n\n\nAs the event organizer, it's your responsibility to ensure your sponsors will be taken care of well after your big day is over. Keep in touch with them to show you appreciate their business and in case they'd like to support your other events in the future. As part of your&nbsp;post-event strategy, send them an occasional email during your event's off-season (like around the holidays) to keep you in the back of their minds. This'll make reaching back out to them for another sponsorship easier. With these established relationships, you'll know exactly how to find sponsors for an event in the future!\n","date":"16 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6205306eaf8a44b2540b6f8d_find-event-sponsors-cover-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

When your doors finally open, even the smallest details can have a big impact on your success, from communication plans, to hydration stations, to parking. Want to make sure you have everything complete and accounted for? You've come to the right place! Our team has put together an event day checklist to double-check that you have all the essentials covered before the big day.\n\n\n\nDownload our full checklist\u00a0today to use as a reference guide during your event preparations!\n\n\n\n1. Check in with your team\n\n\n\nMeet with your entire&nbsp;event staff&nbsp;(including volunteers!) at the beginning of the day to confirm all hands are on deck.&nbsp;Go over key topics&nbsp;like your admissions strategy, security details, emergency plans, and your full event schedule so everyone knows what to expect throughout the day. And be sure to give everyone easy access to your event schedule, whether as digital or hard copies, so they can check what's going on at any time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Meet with your vendors and special guests\n\n\n\nMake time to touch base with each of your third-party vendors, special guests, and&nbsp;media personnel, ensuring they're clear on their role for the day and your expectations of them. This can include reviewing your shot list with your photographer, clarifying what sized bags your security team will allow in, or discussing the event schedule with your special guests. You can even go above and beyond by providing them with personalized itineraries for event day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Solidify your communication plan with staff\n\n\n\nNo matter the size of your event, clear communication between team members is key to successful event operations. Establish where and how you'll be doing your main communicating, whether it be via walkie-talkies, in-ears, text, or a group messaging app like Slack or Discord. We also highly recommend laying out a role hierarchy so each staff member knows who to go to with questions or escalations. For this, it's key to clarify not only who everyone's main point of contact is, but also secondary contacts for emergencies. Share these contacts with all staff.\n\n\n\n4. Check the WiFi\n\n\n\nYou can never verify your WiFi connection too often! If large crowds of attendees use your WiFi at once, it's not uncommon for your connection to slow down or become unstable. That's why you need to have a clear backup plan in case of temporary outages, which can include setting up mobile hotspots or connecting to a nearby building's WiFi. If you're really in a pinch, plugging into an ethernet cord is a great way to ensure stable internet connection for your most important devices. Whatever your solution is, make sure you're password protecting your data all the time!\n\n\n\n5. Confirm weather-dependent accommodations\n\n\n\nThe weather can be unpredictable, so it's vital to remain flexible for event day. If you're hosting an outdoor event, make sure you're prepared for every type of weather condition. This could include purchasing heaters, fans, tents, or ponchos, or moving your event indoors. If plans do change, be sure to update your attendees and staff as soon as possible. Even if you've planned to be at an indoor venue all along, while it may seem obvious, you should check that your A\/V, air conditioning, and heating systems are all working properly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Finalize your admissions strategy\n\n\n\nThe key to minimizing event queuing is having a solid admissions strategy and sticking to it. Prior to your event, plan how you'll direct the lines to maximize floor space and clearly differentiate between different lines (like VIP, box office, and mobile check-in) using stanchions, floor tape, or spray paint if you're outside. Have staff stationed at your entrances to help approaching customers get to the right check-in line. Lastly, verify all your exits and entrances are easily accessible and visible. If you're expecting a larger crowd, consider setting up more entry points to get your attendees in as fast as possible!\n\n\n\n7. Test all event tech\n\n\n\nTesting your event technology is crucial to ensuring your admissions will run as smoothly as possible. First, verify that all your scanners, card readers, phones, and walkie-talkies are fully charged and working properly. Then, set aside time for every staff member to test scanning tickets, manually looking up orders, and making payments at the door. Pro-tip: keep backup chargers and extra batteries handy for an extra power boost if you need it!\n\n\n\n8. Set up clear event signage\n\n\n\nEnsure all your event signage is on display and clearly labeled for key places like concessions, your service desk, bathrooms, water stations, and your exits and entrances. Set out&nbsp;sponsored display ads&nbsp;and signs to their booths in high-traffic areas of your venue for maximum attention. And don't forget to upload your entire venue layout on your website or mobile app so your attendees can easily reference it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9. Communicate your parking plan\n\n\n\nWith proper planning, you can make parking a painless part of your event day experience. Before cars pull in, set up signs to your parking lot and station staff to direct traffic and maximize your lot space. You'll also want to designate a preferred parking area for VIPs, special guests, and reporters. Make sure you clearly communicate if there's a parking fee and accepted payments (cash, credit, etc.), and know where the closest ATM is just in case.\n\n\n\n10. Gather additional supplies\n\n\n\nSome of the smallest details can make all the difference later! For example, keep a basic tool kit on hand to give your equipment some quick TLC at a moment's notice. Check that you have extra extension cords and some gaffer tape to cover any stray cords across the floor. And, most importantly, have a basic first aid kit close by for minor injuries. After all, safety first!\n\n\n\n11. Take care of yourself and others!\n\n\n\nWith how many hats you wear as an event organizer, remember to practice some self-care. This includes (but is not limited to) staying hydrated, making time to grab a cup of coffee, getting enough sleep the night before, and wearing comfortable shoes! And don't forget to look out for your fellow staff members and make sure they're taking care of themselves, too. Remember: you're all in this together!\n\n\n\nLook at that, you've made it! If you follow this day of event checklist and&nbsp;our full event planning checklist, you'll gain more peace of mind than ever that all your operations are accounted for. If you're working with an online ticketing platform like&nbsp;TicketLeap, you'll even have a&nbsp;friendly support team by your side to help with any event questions you may have.\n\n\n\nAnd don't forget to\u00a0download a\u00a0printable version of this checklist\u00a0to use during your big day!\n","date":"16 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/62ebc598565918308868ec37_tl-event-day-checklist-OPTED-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

You don't need a huge budget to build buzz. Check out our top eight tips to increase ticket sales without spending a dime.\n\n\n\n1. Write a great event description\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nSure, you're excited about your event, but why should your potential attendees be? A good\u00a0event description\u00a0answers that question. It should be both informative (date, time, etc.) and compelling. So go ahead and get creative! Put yourself in their shoes, think about how you want your event to make them feel, and let your words mirror that emotion. Include some version of this description on your event page, social media profiles, and anywhere else you're talking about your event.\n\n\n\n2. Share your event URL everywhere to boost ticket sales\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nOne of the many benefits of using a ticketing platform is that it gives you the ability to create a beautiful, professional-looking event page in minutes. This means that you also have a custom URL to share on social media to promote your event and sell tickets online easily and securely. If you know where your audience likes to hang out online, you're all set to start promoting.\n\n\n\nShare your event page link on X, in your Instagram bio, and anywhere else your potential attendees can be found. If your organization has a Facebook group, share your link there and encourage your followers to share it with their audience, too.\n\n\n\n3. Create the perfect hashtag\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nA custom hashtag is a valuable resource when it comes to boosting your event ticket sales. It's a great way for your past, present, and future attendees to find your event across almost any social media platform. Choose a hashtag that's catchy, relevant, and unique. Use your hashtag in all of your marketing efforts and encourage your attendees to do the same. That way, when they share&nbsp;fun photos from your event, it's easy to find them later (especially when you need photos to promote your future events).\n\n\n\n4. Find sponsors your audience will love\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nSponsorships help increase your ticket revenue because they add value to your event without requiring you to spend extra money. This means you can increase your&nbsp;ticket price&nbsp;and your attendees will still feel they're getting a bang for their buck. Some sponsorships are monetary donations, which allows you to increase your budget from previous events in whatever way will delight your audience the most: a swankier venue, a celebrity guest, or a great DJ.\n\n\n\nOther sponsorships involve donations of goods or services, like a restaurant providing lunch at no cost, or a company providing volunteers to staff your event. In return, your sponsors' brand gets a presence at your event so they can grow their audience as well. Win-win!\n\n\n\n5. Blog about your event\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nIf your organization has a blog, post about your event in the weeks leading up to the big day. Be sure to link to your event page in these and other blog posts. If you don't have a blog, try reaching out to bloggers with an audience that would be interested in your event. For example, if your event is family-friendly, a local parenting blogger would be the perfect person to reach out to. Keep your message short, concise, and genuine. Include their name in the salutation so it doesn't feel spammy or impersonal, and only reach out if you think their audience is truly a good match for your event.\n\n\n\n6. Build your community\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nWe already mentioned sharing your event page link on social media, but don't forget to go deeper and find online communities that would be interested in your event. Join Facebook groups, subreddits, and neighborhood\/local groups that are relevant to the theme of your event.&nbsp;Post about your event&nbsp;in these groups, but also make a point to check out other group members' posts and comment and interact with them. It's a great way to increase event ticket sales and build some real relationships at the same time.\n\n\n\n7. Take advantage of limited-time offers\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nHave you ever added an item to your cart while shopping online, only to click away before actually buying it? If so, you'll understand how adding a sense of urgency can drive sales. When setting up your event page, create early bird tickets that are priced lower than your regular tickets and only available for a limited time. Promote this early bird deal on social media, and be sure to let your audience know that the offer ends soon. (Note: TicketLeap\u2019s platform always includes multiple ticket types, while other ticketing platforms may charge more for this option. Keep this in mind if you\u2019re shopping around.) \n\n\n\n8. Don't forget about in-person opportunities\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nSometimes, nothing compares to a face-to-face interaction. Network at events similar to yours, or any events with a shared audience. Keep business cards on hand with links to your social media profiles and event page, and your event hashtag. (Don't go bigger than a business card. People are less inclined to hold on to anything that's too large to tuck into their wallets.) If you know what stores or restaurants your audience frequents, leave flyers there.

After all, first impressions are extremely important! You'll want the description of your event to be so compelling that they can't help but buy their tickets. To help you with this, we've got some tips on how to write an event description that'll drive you more ticket sales.\n\n\n\nThere's buzz going around about your upcoming event \u2013 awesome! You're super close to scoring that ticket sale and seeing that new attendee at your next event. Now the real fun starts! Once they reach your&nbsp;event listing&nbsp;and get serious about buying tickets, you'll want to make sure you have all the important info displayed accurately and looking great. And that all starts with your event's description!\n\n\n\n6 best practices for a successful event description\n\n\n\nHaving a vibrant description of your event is something you'll want to have squared away before you&nbsp;launch your ticket sales. Let's dive into how to describe an event on various platforms (whether that be on your ticketing page, website, or social media) in the most compelling way possible!\n\n\n\n1. Be specific\n\n\n\nThis first step is by far the most important. Communicate all the important info about your event to your readers. This'll create the firm foundation you'll build your description off of. To start, make an outline of all the essential info you need to cover. This may include:\n\n\n\n\nEvent date(s)\n\n\n\nEvent start and end time(s)\n\n\n\nLocation (or where you'll stream from if it's a&nbsp;virtual event)\n\n\n\nNotable guests, instructors, lineup, or activities\n\n\n\nBasic agenda\n\n\n\nYour refund policy\n\n\n\nAny age restrictions, especially if you're&nbsp;serving alcohol\n\n\n\nDress code\n\n\n\nProtocol in case of bad weather\n\n\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, your event description should answer the questions \u201cwho?\u201d, \u201cwhat?\u201d, \u201cwhen?\u201d, \u201cwhere?\u201d,&nbsp; and \u201cwhy?\u201d of your event. For any info that's more in the weeds (like parking or what to bring), you can always direct people to your website or send them further details via email leading up to&nbsp;your event day.\n\n\n\n2. Get people excited\n\n\n\nHighlight what makes your event unique and a must-see opportunity! This is called your unique value proposition or UVP. You'll want to answer the question \u201cso what?\u201d, especially for potential customers who're on the fence. Why is it worth spending time and money to come to your event? Why should people go to your event versus staying home or going somewhere else that day?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs you're writing, let your personality shine through, and don't be afraid to play off people's emotions a bit (whether that be excitement or a little FOMO). When possible, you should definitely feature high-quality&nbsp;and videos from previous events to drive home how awesome it's going to be too.\n\n\n\n3. Sprinkle in social proof\n\n\n\nWant to take your event description up a notch? Incorporating social proof can make your event more appealing, especially once you back up how awesome it's going to be. Have you sold out your event in the past? Mention that! Add a brief bio about the accomplishments of the most notable guest speakers or artists in your lineup. Consider sharing estimated attendance numbers based on previous years, if you have them (maybe something like, \u201cour art fair is one of the largest cultural events in the area, with an average annual attendance of more than 15,000 people\u201d). Highlighting who's&nbsp;sponsoring your event&nbsp;will amp up your credibility as well. Maybe even use testimonials from past attendees or guest speakers, talking about their personal experience at your event.\n\n\n\n4. Ensure it's SEO-friendly\n\n\n\nAs part of&nbsp;your SEO efforts, you'll definitely want to incorporate keywords related to your event's location, general topic, and the year. For example, if you're hosting a fall festival in Columbus, Ohio, you'll want to include keywords like \u201cfestivals in Columbus,\u201d \u201cColumbus fall festivals,\u201d etc. Incorporate your organization's name, notable guest names, and any other terms people may search for. You'll also want to write slight variations of your event description for the different online locations it might be posted in. Each platform is different, so your descriptions should be slightly different too!\n\n\n\n5. Make it easy to read\n\n\n\nIn reality, most people will skim your description, so you'll want to make it as easy for them absorb all your important info as they do. How do you do that? By being concise! Rather than using huge blocks of text, write in bite-sized paragraphs. This is better for mobile devices too, which is important since most people are viewing from their phones nowadays. Should your description need to be longer, include headers and bulleted or numbered lists for easier readability.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Mold your description to the platform\n\n\n\nHot take, not all platforms are created equal! As you craft your event description, think about how you'll modify it for your website, your&nbsp;Facebook event listing, and (most importantly!) your ticketing page. Length will vary depending on what's best for the platform you're using as part of your&nbsp;marketing strategy&nbsp;(i.e., website, socials, ticketing page, etc.). For example, your ticketing page should be pretty detailed, but your website should go even more in depth to address specific questions. On the other hand, keep your description brief for social media, piquing their interest with the high points and directing people to your website or ticketing page to learn more.\n\n\n\nPro tip: Looking for some extra help?

For you, they're a powerful way to fuel your event's experiences and boost your bottom line. For your sponsors, they're the key to tapping into new audiences and driving more business to their company. An irresistible sponsorship package is the cornerstone to creating a dynamic event duo! To help you get started, here are our tips on sponsorship packages that'll turn your sponsorship pitch into a long-lasting relationship.\n\n\n\nWhat are event sponsorship packages?\n\n\n\nAn event sponsorship package is the bundle of perks an individual or business gains in exchange for supporting your event. This package should be put together before your initial contact with prospective sponsors, since this will be your starting point for negotiations. Ideally, event sponsorship packages add value and visibility to your sponsor, while giving your event additional credibility, increased budget, and an enhanced guest experience. In other words, it's a win-win opportunity for both of you!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUltimately, a sponsor's primary goal is to gain a return on their investment (or ROI). Therefore, your sponsorship package should showcase all the ways this deal will benefit them. You may grant them various opportunities like new customer leads, access to attendee data, exposure to new audiences, brand placements, booth space, or speaking opportunities at your event.\n\n\n\nThe key is to first conduct your research to&nbsp;find the perfect sponsors, ones whose brand aligns with yours. Then, when pitching your package, you'll be able to show them exactly why the two of you are the right fit.\n\n\n\nTwo main types of sponsorship packages\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into how to make one, let's go over the two primary types of sponsorship for events. This'll help you decide what's best for your event's needs!\n\n\n\nTiered sponsorships\n\n\n\nThis type of sponsorship allows you to bundle your available opportunities at different price points to best suit your sponsor's budget. Tiers are great at conveying exclusivity, paving a clear path towards ROI, and making the decision-making process simpler. We recommend using a naming convention for your tiers that accurately reflects the benefits of each. You may consider basing them off your event's theme or go with a classic approach like having platinum, gold, silver, and bronze tiers.\n\n\n\nA la carte sponsorships\n\n\n\nLooking for an even more customizable approach to your sponsorship packages? Build out your full list of perks for sponsors to choose from. That way, they can pick exactly what they want. This is also an effective option for sponsors who may want to offer other things like giveaway items or free food in exchange for a sponsorship.\n\n\n\nHow to build your sponsorship package\n\n\n\nAlright, so you've got a solid grasp on what event sponsorship packages are. Now, let's go step by step through the various elements of crafting your dream sponsorship package!\n\n\n\n1. Kick off with your event's value proposition\n\n\n\nRight off the bat, you want to showcase your event's unique value proposition (or UVP) in the introduction of your sponsorship package. Why are you the perfect partner to sponsor with? What makes you stand out? Why should they choose you over another event? Highlight your event's reach, reputation, and community impact, on top of anything else that'll help shine the spotlight on you, your event, and your goals. Be sure to share essential details about your event like the date, time, and location too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Outline your audience size and demographics\n\n\n\nHard numbers are essential for proving that your event taps into your sponsor's target audience. In your sponsorship package, outline&nbsp;compelling metrics&nbsp;on how many people typically attend your events and what the demographics of your attendees look like. If you've used TicketLeap's intuitive software before, you can easily pull reports on past attendance numbers or use answers from your&nbsp;custom registration questions&nbsp;to learn more about your attendees. You could also go above and beyond by sharing a breakdown of your social media following, your average number of website visitors, or the total recipients of your newsletter. As a rule of thumb, the more specific numbers you can present, the better. That way, the data will convince sponsors for you!\n\n\n\n3. Highlight your sponsorship opportunities\n\n\n\nThis is the bread and butter of your sponsorship package! Dedicate the bulk of your sponsorship deck to clearly showcasing your complete smorgasbord of opportunities. If you're presenting your packages as tiers, consider displaying them in a table to clearly delineate between what they'll get for various price points. The key here is to be as clear and detailed in your communication as possible. Looking for some extra inspiration on what to offer potential sponsors? We've included a list of 10 irresistible sponsorship package examples near the end of this blog to help you!\n\n\n\n4. Showcase your sponsorship's benefits\n\n\n\nAlongside your more technical list of opportunities, you'll need to emphasize the potential ROI associated with them. This could include gaining exposure in high-traffic areas of your event, leads for new customers, new traffic to their website, or revenue from selling their products onsite. You should also highlight how your opportunities foster quality connections between sponsors and attendees, from encouraging conversations at their booth, hosting interactive workshops, or giving live product demos. To add extra credibility and make your offer even more persuasive, you can also level up your package with featured case studies and\/or testimonials from past sponsors, talking about what a great experience it was to work alongside you!\n\n\n\n5. Design your sponsorship package with compelling visuals\n\n\n\nHow your sponsorship package looks is equally as important as the content within it. Present your package in a sleek, professional way that incorporates your event's branding and logos throughout the pages. Include colorful visual aids like charts and graphs to illustrate your demographic breakdowns and your list of opportunities. Feature&nbsp;high-quality event photos&nbsp;throughout, plus add headers, subheaders, and bulleted lists to make it easier to read at a glance. For putting this all together in a slide deck or .pdf, programs like Google Slides, Adobe Illustrator, and Canva will be your best friend! There's also plenty of templates available online if you'd like to use one as your starting point.\n\n\n\n6. Include your contact info\n\n\n\nMaybe this goes without saying, but be sure to include your name (and\/or the name of whomever handles sponsorships on your&nbsp;event staff), email, and phone number into your sponsorship deck. Consider adding this on the first page, in the footer, and\/or the last page of your sponsorship deck for any follow up questions. This simple yet essential step will ensure the conversation can keep on going!\n\n\n\n10 event sponsorship perks to include\n\n\n\nAt the heart of an enticing event sponsorship package is a list of opportunities that'll resonate with your audience. The key is to not only gain exposure to your sponsor's brand, but to have attendees genuinely engage with it. To help bolster your list of offerings, we've got some intriguing ideas that both your sponsors and your attendees will love!\n\n\n\n1. Sponsored VIP experiences\n\n\n\nSponsoring backstage events is sure to make your sponsor the talk of the town! Depending on what your event is, you could offer meet &amp; greets with your special guests, pre-show performances from your performers, exclusive Q&amp;A or networking sessions, or a behind-the-scenes tour of your&nbsp;haunted attraction.\n\n\n\n2. Speaking opportunities\n\n\n\nLet your sponsors share the spotlight at your event with opportunities to present to your attendees. Watch them shine as they share their industry knowledge and stories in a panel, lecture, or workshop about a topic they're passionate about!\n\n\n\n3. Art installations\n\n\n\nBuild an&nbsp;Instagram-worthy&nbsp;backdrop for your attendees to pose and take pictures with! As some ideas, you could have a backdrop covered in flowers, balloons, or string lights with their logo prominently displayed in the background. You could even consider creating a&nbsp;sustainable art installation&nbsp;out of recycled materials like refurbished doors or streamers of reused fabric.\n\n\n\n4. Branded swag\n\n\n\nEveryone loves free stuff! The key with these freebies is to give attendees something they'll find super useful, making your sponsor even more memorable as attendees continue to use it well after your event. For example, if your event is outdoors in the summer, a company could put their logo and information on free fans or water bottles you could hand out to attendees to cool off with. Your sponsors could also sponsor\u00a0swag bags\u00a0or items inside of them. Feel free to get imaginative, and really think outside the box!\n\n\n\n5. Giveaways\n\n\n\nConnect your sponsors and your attendees together with giveaways featuring valuable items from your sponsor! As part of your&nbsp;event marketing efforts, you could host a giveaway on social media where your followers can enter to win if they tag friends in the comments and follow your sponsor. You could do raffles onsite too, with exclusive prizes for your ticket buyers!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Online brand placements\n\n\n\nYou could have your sponsor appear in a prominent place on your website or your mobile app, as a partner on your&nbsp;Facebook event page, or as a collaborator on your Instagram posts. You could also host a&nbsp;live stream on TikTok, Facebook, or Instagram featuring your sponsor. On your stream, you chat with them about their work in the community and at your event, do an interactive workshop, or play fun games (as just a few ideas). These are great efforts to include alongside our social media giveaway idea above!\n\n\n\n7. Photo booth or backdrop\n\n\n\nLet your attendees have a blast in a photo booth provided by your sponsor! You could include their branding on the props attendees can wear or hold up when posing for their photos. You could place the sponsor's logo on the corner of the photos printed out from the booth too. If you're hosting a more formal event like a&nbsp;fundraising gala&nbsp;or film festival, try displaying your sponsors' logos on a large backdrop behind them as they walk a red carpet and get their picture taken!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Food\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love some free food? Have your sponsor provide a catered meal during your event, or to satisfy your attendees' sweet tooth, you could also offer branded cupcakes or cookies that are sure to impress! This is especially perfect for potential restaurants, bakeries, or other food-related companies you may partner with.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9. Booths\n\n\n\nOffer your sponsor a designated booth space to show off what their company is all about and encourage on-the-ground conversations with your attendees (aka, their future customers!). You could even incorporate a scavenger hunt or another kind of game into your event to encourage guests to visit your sponsor's booth to win some prizes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n10. Sponsored live stream\n\n\n\nTake your event global with a&nbsp;live stream&nbsp;of your in-person event, provided by your sponsor. Incorporate their branding before and during the stream, have your sponsor engage with your virtual audience via polls and live chat, and add a call-to-action link to make their company's site easily accessible.\n\n\n\n\u200d\n\n\n\nThere you have it! You're now fully equipped to build a stellar event sponsorship package of your own. Be intentional with further discussing your opportunities with potential sponsorships in person, over the phone, or through a video call. Ultimately, you can pitch to your prospective sponsors with confidence, knowing your event's sponsorship package will let them shine!\n","date":"10 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6512ed862331afa141929b3f_two-businessmen-high-fiving-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

If you provide attendees with branded items that have everyday practical use, those attendees could turn into a walking\u00a0promotion for your event\u00a0whenever they use them. Attention-grabbing items can spark conversations, causing people to unexpectedly promote your event and brand image. Not to mention, gifting an event swag bag will be sure to make your attendees feel even more appreciated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4 ways to source budget-friendly swag bag items\n\n\n\nA lot of times for organizers, event swag bags are sure to add a valuable touch but may be a challenge to execute, depending on your budget. Since staying within your budget is a crucial part of event success, here are four ways to source swag bag items cost-effectively to make gifting them to your attendees more feasible!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Research suppliers\n\n\n\nDo your due diligence when researching suppliers! Look for companies that offer competitive pricing for the types of swag items you're looking for without sacrificing quality. Reading&nbsp;reviews can ensure reliability and customer satisfaction with the company's ability to customize as the buyer intended. For some ideas, you may consider&nbsp;Swag, SwagMagic, or&nbsp;SwagUp&nbsp;as potential suppliers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Bulk order\n\n\n\nSome suppliers may offer bulk discounts if you order larger quantities of swag items. By taking advantage of these promotional offers, you can help reduce the unit cost and\u00a0maximize your budget!\n\n\n\n3. Collaborate with sponsors\n\n\n\nReach out to\u00a0your sponsors! Consider ways you could collaborate with them to provide swag items. For example, you could include some free samples of their products into your swag bags. This allows you to provide goodies for your attendees, while saving you money and offering\u00a0sponsorship opportunities\u00a0that creatively promote their company too!\n\n\n\n4. Simplify packaging&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo help minimize costs where you can, try simplifying your packaging so you can focus on the items within your swag bags. Opt for cost-effective packaging options like kraft bags and tissue paper.\n\n\n\n6 fresh swag bag ideas&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt's no secret that people love free stuff! That said, since swag bags have been around for some time, you may want to think outside the box so your freebies will be even more memorable than the more classic items. Shake things up with the following event swag ideas to surprise your attendees with unexpected items that'll leave a lasting impression!\n\n\n\n1. Self-care products&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEncourage attendees to make self-care a priority by incorporating wellness products into their event swag bag! Aromatherapy candles, stress balls, mini massagers, bath bombs, or even a meditation journal are all awesome ideas to promote\u00a0mindfulness at your events.\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. Eco-friendly items\n\n\n\nPracticing\u00a0event sustainability\u00a0not only helps our environment's well-being, it also shows your brand's commitment to eco-consciousness and encourages your attendees to do the same. As part of your efforts, offer sustainable swag items like reusable water bottles, eco-friendly notebooks, biodegradable tote bags, or even bamboo utensil sets! Pro tip: If you're creating corporate swag bag ideas, bamboo utensil sets are a great addition so your employees can use them on their lunch breaks!\n\n\n\n3. Customized apparel&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncluding customized apparel and accessories like t-shirts, hats, bracelets, or socks (everyone loves socks) will transform your attendees into walking event promo! This way attendees can show their affiliation and foster brand loyalty, all while creating a sense of exclusivity. Get creative with your logo placements and curate a piece that can easily fit into an individual's wardrobe so they're sure to wear it often!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Tech gadgets&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdd a modern touch to your swag items with tech gadgets and accessories like mini Bluetooth speakers, portable chargers, or tiny trackers to help you find your lost keys. These items are both useful and super convenient!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Gourmet goodies\n\n\n\nFood is always a crowd-pleaser and will give your attendees a memorable taste of your event! Consider adding artisan chocolates, mini snacks, candy, or gum to your swag bag. Go the extra mile if you can and customize the packaging of your chosen goodies for a more personal touch!\n\n\n\n6. Virtual gifts\n\n\n\nVirtual swag bag ideas are an unconventional way to gift your attendees from a distance! On top of traditional items like e-gift cards or coupons, you could think about providing attendees of your&nbsp;virtual event&nbsp;with a beneficial subscription or free link to a virtual fitness class, online wine tasting, e-books, or even a cooking class.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHanding out your swag bags&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are a few ways you can handle distributing your swag bags at your event. For one, you could have a designated swag bag pickup area near your registration desk or check-in station where attendees can collect their bags as they walk in. This allows you to impress them from the moment they arrive, plus they can put other things in their bag throughout your event day too. As another option, your staff or volunteers could hand out swag bags directly to attendees during a specific time while your event is underway. You could also set up a booth inside your venue for attendees to grab their bags while browsing around, after your main activities wrap up, or as they get ready to leave. We recommend implementing a mixture of these methods, depending on the layout of your event!\n\n\n\nReady to put together a swag bag for your next event?

Thrill-seekers everywhere are more ready than ever to put their courage to the test at your attraction, so you need to be sure you're using the right ticketing features. And TicketLeap is here to help! Read on for our event experts' eight event ticketing features you need to pull off your biggest scare yet.\n\n\n\n1. Branded haunt event pages\n\n\n\nFirst up: You need a fully branded event page that gives your customers an easy ticket buying experience while showing them all the most important info about your haunt. Your ticketing platform should make it simple to create a spooky-looking event page that works on any device, and is easily customizable&nbsp;so you can quickly start selling haunt tickets online!\n\n\n\n2. Timed entry for your haunted house\n\n\n\nBeyond general admission pricing, your event ticketing platform needs to have timed ticketing for haunted attractions. Why, you may ask? Because being able to control capacity throughout the day for your haunt is the key to a successful season. With TicketLeap, you can control how many people are in your event by selling tickets at individual time slots separated by minutes, hours, or days. Plus, with our bulk editing tool, you can update important info (like ticket prices and event details) across your haunt's dates and times instantly!\n\n\n\n3. Sell tickets online and onsite\n\n\n\nWhile selling tickets online is your bread and butter, you definitely need to have scary simple ticketing at the gate, too. Those onsite ticket sales can add a nice boost to your annual revenue! If you're already using an event ticketing platform, make sure you can easily manage cash and card payments at the door.\n\n\n\n4. Built-in waivers and registration\n\n\n\nAdd custom waivers and registration questions right into your checkout process for a scary easy way to collect the customer information you desire most. Plus, not only will you be able to forewarn attendees of the screams and scares they'll experience at your haunt, you'll speed up the onsite check-in process ten-fold!\n\n\n\n5. Ticketing scanning app\n\n\n\nIf you've ever attended a haunted house or other Halloween event, you know the pain of slow-moving check-in lines. So you want to make sure you partner up with a ticketing platform that provides you with a free ticket scanner app that allows you to check in your next victims at lightning-fast speed and sell additional tickets at the gate (like TicketLeap!)\n\n\n\n6. Built-in marketing tools\n\n\n\nA ticketing platform worthy of working with your haunt will have the tools to help you manage your entire marketing campaign. For example, your platform should let you add custom messaging to your ticket confirmation emails to share important event details and thank your customers for their purchase. You should also be able to send email blasts to attendees before and after your haunt, share news or discounts with your social media audience, and so much more!\n\n\n\n7. Smart reporting\n\n\n\nDiscover more about your customers, like their location and interests, and use that information to take your haunted attraction to the next level. By connecting services like Google Analytics, you'll learn exactly where haunt-seekers are coming from and what they're most excited for, so you can give them an event experience they'll never forget (even in their nightmares).\n\n\n\n8. Friendly support\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to support, every ticketing platform is not created equal. You need a friendly and experienced team ready to answer all of your questions. If you need help setting up your event listing, want to talk strategy for your admissions, or determine how your ticketing platform can best suit your event\u2019s unique needs, you deserve an expert team by your side.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right ticketing platform for haunted attractions\n\n\n\nWhen you're looking for an event ticketing system with the right features to support you this haunt season, choose an easy-to-use event ticketing platform with simple, straightforward pricing like TicketLeap!

You\u2019ve come to the right place! Event-goers are more excited than ever for a fun, engaging event experience, so you need to make the most of that excitement by promoting your event to as many potential ticket buyers as possible. Dive into our team\u2019s event marketing tips designed to help you maximize ticket sales, get your event in front of more people, and keep your attendees coming back for more.\n\n\n\nWhy does event marketing matter?\n\n\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: what is event marketing, and how can it help your business? It\u2019s simple! Event marketing is how you spread the word about your event. This can range from asking your friends and family to share it with others, to posting on social media, to developing a multi-pronged digital marketing campaign. Essentially, it\u2019s your chance to connect with potential attendees in a way that makes sense for your business.\n\n\n\nBuilding a marketing strategy is a key step in preparing for your event and will play a big part in your overall success. You could secure your venue, plan your programming, set up a ticketing page, and more; however, until you market the event, no one is going to know to come!\n\n\n\nWhat does successful marketing for events look like? Show people how awesome your event is and all the ways they'd benefit from attending! As you'll learn through this guide, every time you showcase your upcoming event to people, you're drawing them closer and closer to finally buying their tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the marketing funnel can help\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the marketing funnel is like having a roadmap to create a foolproof marketing strategy for your event. Everyone who interacts with your events\u2019 marketing falls into one of five categories \u2014 awareness, interest, consideration, action, or advocacy \u2014 and knowing where they are in the funnel helps you meet them with the right message at the right time. From broadest to narrowest, here's a summary of each level of the event marketing funnel and what they're about:\n\n\n\n\nAwareness = gaining exposure for your event and getting in front of people so they recognize you\n\n\n\nInterest = introducing who you are and letting people know what your events are all about\n\n\n\nConsideration = providing additional information and reasons to attend for those who are seriously considering if it\u2019s worth coming to your event\n\n\n\nAction = getting people to convert into paying customers (like purchasing tickets!)\n\n\n\nAdvocacy = encouraging their friends about you and coming to your events year after year\n\n\n\n\nThe key is to craft a strategy that taps into all these levels because it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all process. Some potential attendees may need a bit more convincing than others, and that\u2019s okay! Using a mix of marketing channels, like social media for awareness or email campaigns for consideration, ensures you're speaking effectively to people in different stages. While not every marketing effort will result in an immediate ticket sale, every touchpoint nudges someone closer to attending your event. By viewing the big picture and tailoring your approach, you'll create a strategy that inspires action and builds loyal fans for your events!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I measure the success of my event marketing?\n\n\n\nBefore you dive into the nitty-gritty of your event marketing plan, you need to determine specific and achievable goals you want to reach, along with how to measure those goals. To do this, set up key performance indicators (KPIs). Basically, KPIs are targets for your team to shoot for, or milestones to gauge your progress towards a larger goal. As your marketing efforts progress, you can use KPIs to measure how they\u2019re performing and how they\u2019re contributing to your overall goal. Then, use that data to make adjustments to your campaigns as you go.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThroughout this article, we\u2019ll include KPIs to consider for each marketing channel, so you can evaluate what\u2019s working and what needs improvement to help maximize your ticket sales. And remember, success will look different depending on your goals and the purpose of each channel based on the marketing funnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the essential channels for my event marketing strategy?\n\n\n\nA powerful event marketing strategy starts with selecting the right mix of channels to spread the word and excite your audience. Diversifying your channels \u2014 like leveraging social media for eye-catching posts, using email campaigns to directly engage with your most loyal followers, and collaborating with partners or influencers to tap into new audiences \u2014 maximizes your reach. While there are even more channels out here, here are the channels we'll dive more into throughout this guide:\n\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\n\nEmail campaigns\n\n\n\nYour event website\n\n\n\nYour ticketing page\n\n\n\nReferral incentives\n\n\n\nPublic relations\n\n\n\nTraditional marketing\n\n\n\nSponsorships\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it so critical to tap into each of these? Because people usually need to hear about your event multiple times, and often in different ways, before deciding to buy tickets. A mix of platforms ensures that your event stays top-of-mind, no matter how someone likes to consume content. The result? More visibility, stronger connections, and a much higher chance of filling those seats!\n\n\n\n1. Social media\n\n\n\n\nImportance: When it comes to drumming up hype for your event, never underestimate the power of social media! All throughout the year, and especially leading up to your event, you should be posting regularly on your Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media profiles. Your event\u2019s social media marketing presence should give them a taste of your unique onsite experiences. This includes posting high-quality photos and videos with short, catchy captions. Then, after your customers buy tickets, keep the engagement going and turn them into free brand ambassadors when they share your event to their own social profiles!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): All levels, but especially Awareness and Interest\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nEngagement rate: Measures the level of interaction with your posts (likes, comments, shares, etc.), showing how well your content resonates with your audience.\n\n\n\nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of people who clicked on your event link after seeing your social media post, helping you gauge how effective your call-to-action is.\n\n\n\nFollower growth: Tracks how your social media following grows leading up to your big day, reflecting the overall interest and awareness of your event.\n\n\n\nHashtag performance: Measures how often your event\u2019s branded hashtags are used, which can give insight into how far your event's social reach is and how many attendees are making content of their own about your event.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nMaintain a regular posting schedule across all your social media channels (e.g., Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn) to keep your event top-of-mind to your followers. This could be anywhere from 3-4 posts a week, up to once a day.\n\n\n\nPost short-form videos (less than 60 seconds is best!) on TikTok and Instagram to take advantage of their massive Gen Z userbase to find new repeat customers. Take your followers through different parts of your event, introduce them to participating artists or staff, show time lapses of setup, and more.\n\n\n\nWhile at your event, encourage attendees to post about their experience using your event\u2019s custom hashtag (e.g., #PrimaFest). When they tag you, be sure to reshare their content on your social profiles to express your gratitude, build credibility, and nurture community.\n\n\n\nPost entertaining and helpful content that resonates with your target audience. Share details about your event, highlight your community, and give shoutouts to fans whenever you can. High-quality images, videos, and infographics perform best here, including sneak peeks, behind-the-scenes content, or teaser trailers.\n\n\n\nOffer free tickets or exclusive perks through social media contests or giveaways!\n\n\n\nDisplay your social media handles everywhere you can. The more places your handles appear, the more opportunities there are for people to follow. Add them to online posts, printed materials, emails \u2013 anywhere you can think of!\n\n\n\nInclude an interactive call-to-action in the post text (not just the caption), like, \u201cTag the biggest concert-lover you know!\u201d or \u201cGet your tickets while they last!\u201d\n\n\n\nCreate a branded event hashtag and use a few popular, relevant hashtags to expand your event\u2019s reach.\n\n\n\nInvite your Facebook friends and those interested in your event to follow you right from an action on your Facebook Page. Sometimes getting your event on the map really is that easy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeploy paid social media ads\n\n\n\nDepending on your event, audience, and budget, paid social advertising may be the perfect way to increase event awareness, gain new followers, and most importantly, sell out your event! Facebook Ads Manager provides a ton of ways to target potential customers on both Facebook and Instagram. When it comes to interest targeting, a user\u2019s \u201cinterests\u201d are based on what they share online, the ads they click, the pages they like, and much more. So, you should target your ads to interests relevant to your event. For example, if you\u2019re promoting a music festival, you might target interests like your event\u2019s performing artists, other local festivals, or music in general.\n\n\n\nTo unlock a new audience and grow your brand awareness after you\u2019ve collected enough purchase data, try exploring Lookalike Audiences. These are created from a source audience of already existing customers. Facebook then identifies common characteristics and creates a new audience for you. Basically, all the heavy lifting is done for you, and you reap the rewards!\n\n\n\nWith paid social ads, you\u2019re most likely reaching a new audience who may not have heard of your event before, so be sure your ads are friendly, informative, and engaging. Include your event details and a call to action to purchase tickets alongside the \u201cBook Now\u201d button. For your ad creative, always test between static images, short videos, and carousel ads to see what your audience interacts with the most. Remember, this is a brand new audience, so you want to select the best photos of your event to stop people in their tracks as they\u2019re scrolling.\n\n\n\nUsing social media to remarket to potential ticket buyers\n\n\n\nDid you know you can target specific website visitors who engaged with your website but have yet to purchase a ticket? With remarketing, you can zero in on those who have shown interest but haven\u2019t quite sealed the deal. These users are way more likely to place an order than those who haven\u2019t heard of your event before, so it\u2019s often more effective to re-target them again rather than start a new, broader campaign. You want to run remarketing campaigns where your audience already spends a lot of their time, like on Facebook and Instagram. If you have customer lists from previous years, remarket to them too! Uploading these lists to Facebook lets you target those specific users via social media ads. Well-timed, targeted, and interesting remarketing ads can easily be the most effective part of your social media marketing toolkit!\n\n\n\n\u200dHere are a few tips to maximize the power of your remarketing ads. Use reminder language to get your audience to buy tickets, while also adding new information about your event. Then, you could feature a testimonial from a recent attendee or influencer, or highlight a part of your event they might not already be aware of. Create a sense of urgency to get customers to buy tickets right away. (e.g., \u201cTickets are selling fast \u2013 get yours before it\u2019s too late!\u201d) Offering a discount to these audiences is another great motivator, like 20% off children\u2019s tickets or free parking. Sometimes the opportunity to save a few bucks is the only push they need!\n\n\n\n2. Email campaigns\n\n\n\n\nImportance: When sent to the right people, email marketing can be a powerful and affordable way to get the word out about your upcoming event. You can build targeted email lists from different sources including past attendees or newsletter subscribers. You already know these audiences are interested in your event, which means they\u2019re more likely to engage with your content and make a purchase!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Interest, Consideration, Action, Advocacy\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nOpen rate: The percentage of recipients who opened your email. This helps determine if your subject lines and timing are effective.\n\n\n\nClick-through rate (CTR): Measures how many people clicked on links inside your email, which can indicate how compelling your event details or offers are.\n\n\n\nConversion rate: The percentage of recipients who took the desired action (e.g., bought tickets or registered), showing the direct impact of your email campaign on ticket sales.\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe rate: Tracks how many people unsubscribed after receiving your email, helping you understand if your email content is not resonating or is being sent too frequently.\n\n\n\nRatings on post-event surveys: In your follow-up emails, these ratings from your post-event survey help you measure success in your event operations and learn areas where you can improve. It's also important to look at your overall response rate, seeing how many people are willing to complete the survey in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nInclude an attention-grabbing subject line that stands out in the inbox (emojis are highly encouraged!). For example, the subject line for a winery event might look like this: \"It\u2019s 5 O\u2019Clock Somewhere \ud83c\udf77\".\n\n\n\nUse your pre-header text to expand on your subject line, like the following: \"The Chicago Wine Festival is back and bigger than ever! Grab your tickets today!\".\n\n\n\nConduct A\/B tests on different subject lines to see which ones drive the best open rates.\n\n\n\nUse dynamic content to personalize your emails! This could include incorporating your recipients\u2019 names either in the subject line and\/or in the body of your email as well as tailoring content to their preferences. The more targeted your emails are, the better!\n\n\n\nSend out event email invitations to get those currently in your community excited about your next event!\n\n\n\nIncentivize early ticket sales by offering discounts if customers purchase tickets by a certain date, or encourage your audience to share your event with their social circles by offering group discounts (e.g., giving them 15% off when they buy four or more tickets).\n\n\n\nAdd an exciting header image from your event to get your audience hyped up about coming! Make sure to also add details about your event, like where and when it is and what to do there.\n\n\n\nMake sure your emails have one clear action for the recipient to take, such as \"Buy Tickets Now\" or \"RSVP Today\" with a link to your event listing.\n\n\n\nSend out email blasts directly from your ticketing platform (ideally for free!). Since all your ticket buyer information is already stored there, this will help keep costs down and segment your customers easier than ever before!\n\n\n\nMake sure to send a thank-you email after your event to encourage them to come back again! You could include a post-event survey or even a discount towards future events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Your event website\n\n\n\n\nImportance: On top of being the central hub for all your information (e.g., event details, ticket sales, and real-time updates), your website can bring in traffic from various channels to help turn them into excited event-goers. A well-designed website not only boosts your event\u2019s credibility and showcases your brand, but it also creates a seamless, user-friendly experience that encourages visitors to take action. As people search online for events near them, your website is a perfect page that could land on. Plus, it effortlessly integrates with other marketing efforts like social media and email campaigns, making it a powerful tool to guide potential attendees from curiosity to commitment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness, Consideration, Action\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nTraffic volume: Measures the number of visitors to your website, indicating general interest in the event.\n\n\n\nBounce rate: Tracks the percentage of visitors who leave your website without interacting. A high bounce rate might suggest that your landing page isn\u2019t compelling enough.\n\n\n\nTime on page: The average time visitors spend on your event website, which can indicate how engaging and informative the site is.\n\n\n\nConversion rate: The percentage of website visitors who complete the desired action (e.g., sign up or purchase tickets), showing the effectiveness of your website in driving ticket sales or registrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nYour event website should be easy to navigate with clear, concise information about your events (date, location, agenda, etc.) and where to buy tickets.\n\n\n\nEnsure your website is optimized for mobile devices since this is how the majority of people will be viewing your site.\n\n\n\nShowcase past event attendees' testimonials or media coverage as social proof on your site to build credibility.\n\n\n\nMake sure it takes as few clicks as possible to navigate from your website to your ticketing page, so the path to registration or buying tickets is intuitive.\n\n\n\nOptimize your website for search engines (i.e., your SEO strategy) by including keywords related to your event type, venue, and target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Your ticketing page\n\n\n\n\nImportance: As an essential starting point to your marketing campaigns, you need an eye-catching event ticketing page to link to. Your event page should act as an extension of your brand, display key event details all in one place, and make it easy to purchase tickets in just a few clicks. A streamlined, well-optimized ticketing page minimizes buying friction, improving the user experience and boosting conversion rates. Plus, it seamlessly integrates with other marketing tools, giving you insights into sales performance and engagement to fine-tune your strategy for maximum success!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Consideration, Action\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nNumber of tickets sold: Tracks how many tickets have been sold, which is the most direct measure of event success.\n\n\n\nTickets per visitor: Tracks how many tickets each visitor buys on average, which can help you understand purchasing behavior.\n\n\n\nNumber of event check-ins: In some cases, the number of event check-ins may be more important than the number of registrations (especially if you\u2019re hosting a free event). If a lot of people are reserving tickets for your event but not showing up, you may want to adjust your marketing efforts to keep people excited and engaged between ticket purchase and event day.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nGet your tickets on sale early so you have plenty of time to reach potential buyers.\n\n\n\nBuild a ticketing page that perfectly matches your branding! This can include the images, colors, and creative messaging on your page.\n\n\n\nShare this link everywhere! Post it across your social media channels, in your emails, on your website, and more.\n\n\n\nCreate a QR code to this ticketing page (TicketLeap auto-generates one for you!) to incorporate on flyers to post around your community.\n\n\n\nMake sure your ticketing page is optimized for mobile devices. Most ticket buyers are making purchases right from their phones, so working with an online ticketing system that makes your event page look great on any device is key!\n\n\n\nOffer early bird pricing or ticket discount codes to incentivize purchases before the event.\n\n\n\nHighlight your most important event details including the date, time, location, and anything they need to know beforehand, like parking info, refund policy, dress code, and other frequently asked questions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDisplay how many tickets have been sold or how many are left to create urgency and encourage potential buyers.\n\n\n\nOffer a sensible weather guarantee for your outdoor events so attendees are more willing to purchase a ticket with peace of mind that they'll get a refund due to inclement weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of ticket discounts\n\n\n\nYou already know a great way to boost your ticket sales is by offering exclusive discounts to select audiences. Early-bird specials are key in enticing event-goers to purchase tickets early. Group tickets are great to incentivize big purchases so family and friends can attend together for less. Loyalty campaigns reward your customers and keep them coming back again and again. No matter how you offer specially priced event tickets, make sure you\u2019re tracking these efforts! Attach unique tracking parameters on your URLs when linking back to your event page for each promotion, influencer, or discount code so you know exactly where sales are coming from.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSign up with a free event ticketing platform\n\n\n\nWhile you can create a successful event marketing strategy on your own, using an event ticketing and management system sure does make it a whole lot easier! With TicketLeap\u2019s free, user-friendly system, you can get your event on sale in just five easy steps. Plus, we have built-in tools to help promote your event, integrations with Google Analytics and other services to learn more about your ticket buyers, and branded event pages that will wow your customers!\n\n\n\n5. Referral incentives\n\n\n\n\nImportance: These are a game-changer for your event marketing strategy because they tap into the unmatched power of word-of-mouth marketing. By encouraging attendees to share your event with their friends, family, and colleagues, you expand your reach in a way that is genuine and trustworthy. Personal recommendations carry immense credibility, making it easier to convert interest into ticket sales and helping you fill your event with enthusiastic attendees!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Advocacy\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nReferral conversion rate: Measures how many people who received a referral offer actually converted (e.g., purchased tickets). This shows how successful your referral program is in generating ticket sales.\n\n\n\nNumber of referrals: Tracks how many new people were referred to your event, indicating how well your referral program is being shared.\n\n\n\nReferral revenue: The total revenue generated through referrals, providing insight into the financial return of your referral incentives.\n\n\n\nReferral traffic: Measures how many website visitors came through referral links, showing how well your referral program drives traffic to your event site.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nProvide enticing rewards, such as discounted tickets, VIP access, or exclusive merchandise, to motivate people to refer their friends!\n\n\n\nUse tracking tools or unique referral codes to easily measure the success of your referral program.\n\n\n\nInclude time-sensitive offers or tiered rewards to encourage people to act fast to take advantage of your deals.\n\n\n\nProvide pre-written text or social media templates for your advocates to share, making it easier for them to refer others.\n\n\n\nActively promote your referral program on social media, email campaigns, and the event website to increase visibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with influencers\n\n\n\nWant to tap into one of the most popular event marketing trends? Scope out local personalities and social media influencers with a devoted following, and work with them to arrange a partnership! Micro-influencers could be the most effective here, with loyal fanbases ranging from 10k-100k followers. They could share video content leading up to your event with an exclusive discount code, and document how much fun they're having at your events. As authenticity becomes one of the most important marketing trends, you might even find that influencer marketing can be more affordable and powerful in reaching new audiences than other paid advertising methods!\n\n\n\n6. Public relations\n\n\n\n\nImportance: When you\u2019re looking to increase awareness of your event, don\u2019t forget about your community! There are plenty of news outlets, magazines, podcasts, blogs, or other local-specific, high-traffic websites you can place ads in or write a sponsored post for. A lot of these outlets offer banner ad placements, in-article ads, and even paid inclusion in their email newsletters, and could help get more publicity for your event, turning readers into potential event-goers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness, Interest\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nMedia coverage volume: Tracks how many media outlets have covered your event, giving insight into the reach and interest of your PR efforts.\n\n\n\nPR impressions: Measures the potential audience reached through press mentions, articles, or interviews.\n\n\n\nSentiment analysis: Analyzes the overall tone and performance of your media coverage, helping you gauge the public\u2019s perception of your event.\n\n\n\nMedia engagement: Tracks how much interaction (shares, comments, etc.) media articles are generating, reflecting how well the coverage is resonating with audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nStart pitching your event well in advance to local journalists and media outlets to secure coverage leading up to the event.\n\n\n\nConsider using an AI writing tool like ChatGPT to give you a solid starting place when writing your perfect press release!\n\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive press kit with high-quality images, event details, and media contacts to make it easy for journalists to report on your event.\n\n\n\nFocus on unique angles or noteworthy elements of your event that will attract media attention, such as headlining speakers or community impact.\n\n\n\nCollaborate with local influencers or thought leaders to amplify your event\u2019s reach and credibility.\n\n\n\nAfter your initial pitch, follow up with reporters and outlets to keep your event on their radar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Traditional marketing\n\n\n\n\nImportance: You can take your promotional efforts offline, too! Classic marketing tactics like flyers, print magazine and newspaper ads, and even billboards are an additional way to drive ticket sales. These channels are especially effective for reaching locals in your community who might not engage as much with digital platforms, ensuring your message reaches a wider demographic. Plus, when paired with digital marketing efforts, traditional methods add an extra layer of visibility and can make your event even harder to miss!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nReach: The total number of people exposed to your traditional marketing materials (flyers, posters, ads, etc.), helping you understand the overall awareness generated. While you can get exact numbers from digital channels, these numbers for your in-person advertisements are likely rough estimates based on foot traffic.\n\n\n\nEvent awareness: Use surveys or polls that track how many people are aware of your event due to traditional marketing, helping you determine if they\u2019re reaching your target audience.\n\n\n\nRedemption rate for promo codes: If you use promo codes in print ads, this measures how many people use the code, giving you insight into the effectiveness of your traditional marketing push.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nIn posters, flyers, and billboards, use bold visuals and simple messaging that stand out to passersby. The rule of thumb for billboards is that people will only read it for six seconds - so keep it short and sweet!\n\n\n\nAdvertise in places where your target audience is likely to be, such as local cafes, universities, or community centers. You could even collaborate with local businesses or organizations to cross promote through flyers, posters, and co-branded materials posted in their buildings.\n\n\n\nSend postcards or brochures to a curated list of potential attendees, especially if your event is niche or local.\n\n\n\nSecure guest spots on local radio shows or TV stations to increase event awareness in your community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sponsorships\n\n\n\n\nImportance: Event sponsorships are a powerful addition to your event marketing strategy because they boost your event's credibility while expanding your reach to new audiences through the sponsor\u2019s network. They also bring valuable resources \u2014 whether it\u2019s funding, products, or services \u2014 that can elevate the overall event experience. Plus, sponsorships are a win-win, offering your partners increased brand visibility and deeper audience connections while helping you create an unforgettable event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness, Advocacy\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nSponsor engagement: Measures how actively sponsors are engaging with your event through social media mentions, event presence, or other collaborative activities.\n\n\n\nSponsorship revenue: The amount of financial support or resources provided by sponsors, helping you evaluate the value of your sponsorship deals.\n\n\n\nBrand exposure for sponsors: Tracks how often your sponsors\u2019 logos or messaging are seen by event attendees or through marketing channels, helping evaluate the ROI for sponsors.\n\n\n\nSponsor satisfaction: Typically measured through surveys, it gauges how satisfied your sponsors are with their partnership and exposure, which can influence your future sponsorship deals and strengthen your relationships with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nFind sponsors whose target audience aligns with your event attendees so you can create mutually beneficial partnerships that drive genuine engagement and maximum value.\n\n\n\nGive sponsors more than just logo placement \u2014 offer opportunities for them to engage directly with your audience, like hosting a workshop or Q&amp;A, putting up a sponsored photo booth, or placing a booth in an area with high foot traffic.\n\n\n\nBuild a compelling event sponsorship package, featuring different levels with varying benefits to appeal to a variety of business sizes and budgets.\n\n\n\nFeature your sponsors across all marketing channels (e.g., social media, email, website) to increase their exposure.\n\n\n\nTry partnering with local restaurants to pass out discount coupons for your event to their customers. This might be just what you need to give your ticket sales that extra boost!\n\n\n\nAfter the event, share the data and feedback you collected with sponsors to show them the return on their investment and build strong future partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster the art of marketing for events\n\n\n\nEvent marketing is key to your event's success! With the right strategy and tools, you can fill your event with excited attendees and make it the talk of the town. By leveraging the channels and best practices outlined in this guide \u2014 social media, email campaigns, referral incentives, traditional marketing, and more \u2014 you can build a well-rounded plan that gets your event in front of the right people at the right time.

We've created a list of unique Halloween party themes for adults that are sure to give your attendees goosebumps! Once you've picked your favorite idea, we strongly encourage you to make it your own and cater it to your event's audience (like toning it down to be more family-friendly, if needed).\n\n\n\n1. Classic horror movie&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor this theme, take inspiration from classic horror films like&nbsp;Nightmare on Elm Street,&nbsp;Halloween, or&nbsp;Frankenstein. Whether your event is centered around one film or you mix in multiple, encourage your attendees to dress up as their favorite characters. As some extra motivation, consider hosting a contest for the most creative costume. Offer prizes like&nbsp;discounted tickets&nbsp;to future events, free merch, etc. You could also test your attendees' Halloween film knowledge with a round of trivia on your chosen movie theme, stirring up a little friendly competition to really top the night off!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Vampires\n\n\n\nGet creative with the blood-sucking details of this theme to really bring your event to life. Think of all the lore associated with vampires, like strings of garlic or the need to avoid sunlight, and incorporate them into your&nbsp;Halloween decorations. As one idea, setting up a serving station of cherry, strawberry, or any red-colored beverage labeled with different blood types can add a hilarious touch that'll have attendees pretending like they're vampires. As another, having your venue dimly lit with the windows boarded up can be a fun play on the idea that vampires burn in the sun.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Mad scientist\n\n\n\nFallen test tubes, microscopes with obscure substances, beakers filled with luminous liquids \u2013 the possibilities of this theme are endless! Set up your scene of chaos with these lab-related decorations, plus some dimmed or flickering lights. At the entrance, use caution tape to section off your check-in lines as you scan people in with your&nbsp;ticket scanning app. When serving food, consider writing your menus out on notebook-styled sheets with the frantic scribblings of a scientist around the edges. Plus, for a more immersive experience in your mad scientist's lab, hook up a fog machine, hand out lab coats to each of your attendees, and turn on some black lights to really make all your chemical concoctions pop.\n\n\n\n4. Carnival\n\n\n\nThere's something naturally unsettling about clowns that can make a carnival one of the perfect scary Halloween themes. From the tiniest woman in the world to double-headed snakes, decorate your venue with the wonders of the world that one may witness at a creepy hometown carnival. On top of the more traditional carnival acts, create some spooky wonders of your own. Invite real paranormal talent like mediums, psychics, or other people with unique abilities like contortionists. And don't forget those classic carnival games! Include games that'll really pull this theme together like balloon darts, whack-a-mole, and fish bowl toss to win some awesome prizes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Edgar Allen Poe&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEdgar Allen Poe is widely known for his tales of terror, so if you're a literature fanatic, this theme is the one for you! Teleport your attendees to the 1800's by decorating your space to match the era. Be sure to include dark birds and aged book paper to reflect Edgar Allen Poe's writing! Encourage your attendees to dress according to the time period to further transport them into the Victorian era. Fine-tune your event's details with references to some of his popular pieces, like decorating with ravens from \u201cThe Raven\u201d or serving wine from Amontillado to reflect his short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado.\u201d To keep your attendees engaged throughout the event, host short activities throughout like trivia, crossword puzzles, or scavenger hunts related to your Halloween theme.\n\n\n\n6. Slaughterhouse\n\n\n\nThis is one of those adult Halloween party themes that's just so frightening, people will want to go with a large group of friends \u2013 which means&nbsp;more ticket sales! Blood, bones, and butcher knives with plastic tarps draped along the walls can make for the perfect entrance to your haunted slaughterhouse. Consider adding signs inside your event of different butcher cuts or directions for butchering an animal.&nbsp;Halloween event safety&nbsp;always comes first, so ensure all seemingly dangerous items are just harmless props and are secured in place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n7. Zombie apocalypse&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe world may be ending, but the party has just begun! Let your guests choose whether they want to come in their best zombie defense gear or in their scariest flesh-eating zombie costume. Offer up appetizing zombie cuisine like jello eyeballs or brain cake. To make your event space look like the apocalypse has begun, use pieces of a manikin dressed in tattered clothing with bite marks to scatter around your venue. Then, dance the night away to Halloween-themed music like \u201cThriller\u201d by Michael Jackson and even recreate the iconic dance moves from his music video!\n\n\n\n8. Exorcist&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPut the \u201ctrick\u201d in trick or treat with this spine-chilling Halloween theme! Incorporate simple illusions like creepy eye-following pictures or gravity-defying objects to make your event seem possessed or allude to a supernatural presence being around. You can even set up a seance table with candles and Ouija boards to add a bit of eerie flare. Consider posting videos of your freaky setup to&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;and other social media platforms to get your attendees morbidly curious about your event!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs you begin your Halloween event planning, be sure to incorporate your theme into your&nbsp;haunt marketing strategy&nbsp;and on your event's ticketing page too.

From your attendance rate to social media metrics, event analytics paint a vibrant picture of your attendees' engagement. Armed with this knowledge, you can fine-tune your strategies, improve your event operations, and craft experiences that better resonate with your attendees. So, hang tight as we break down how to evaluate an event in bite-sized pieces, making it a breeze to grasp.\n\n\n\nKey metrics for event success\n\n\n\nEvent success metrics are like measurable building blocks that give you a clear look at different parts of your event. They let you see how well things are going in ways that everyone can understand. Now, what metrics you decide to track will help you select your event goals and measure your performance. The specific goals you try to reach with these metrics are called your key performance indicators (or KPIs). For instance, as you're keeping an eye on your attendance metrics, your KPI might be boosting attendance by a specific margin. Therefore, think of your metrics and KPIs as the dynamic duo guiding your event evaluation journey toward success.\n\n\n\nThe primary categories of key metrics\n\n\n\nIf you find yourself wondering how to measure event engagement, you've come to the right place! Here are some of the main buckets of different metrics you might gather that'll help you in your event planning:\n\n\n\n1. Attendance metrics\n\n\n\n\nNew vs. returning attendees:&nbsp;Assess how many of your total attendees are first-timers versus who's visited your events before, helping you more fully understand your event's overall turnout.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTicket sales: Track the number of&nbsp;online ticket sales, paying attention to things like the time periods when your sales increased the most, which dates of a multi-day event sold more tickets, and how much you sold of each ticket type (like general admission, VIP, bundles, etc.).\n\n\n\nAttendance rate: Determine how successful you were in converting your signups to actual attendees by calculating the number of attendees from the number of total registrations.\n\n\n\n\n2. Engagement metrics\n\n\n\n\nSocial media engagement: Analyze likes, shares, and comments on your event-related posts on social media platforms like&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Instagram, or&nbsp;TikTok.\n\n\n\nPost-event surveys: Tally the number of completed surveys from your attendees that you'll later analyze to identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nEmail campaign metrics: Assess the open and click-through rates of your marketing emails to determine which campaigns were the most successful at driving additional ticket sales.\n\n\n\nWebsite traffic: View metrics like the click-through rate, page views, and average time on site to understand how a user interacts with your event website.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n3. Conversion metrics\n\n\n\n\nLeads generated: Track the number of new leads acquired during the event (this'll be especially important for your event's sponsors!).\n\n\n\nRevenue by promo code: Assess which promo codes from your&nbsp;event pricing strategy&nbsp;generated the most revenue and get a glimpse of which marketing campaigns were most successful.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpsells:&nbsp;Measure the amount generated from additional revenue streams on event day and through your ticketing site, including merchandise, reserved parking, food, drinks, tickets to future events, and more.\n\n\n\nReturn on investment (ROI): Calculate your event's ROI by comparing the revenue earned from your event against the costs involved in organizing it.\n\n\n\n\n4 tools for gathering event data\n\n\n\nLet's dive into the behind-the-scenes magic! To get a true measure of your event's success, it's essential to collect vital data related to your chosen KPIs. From event management software to website analytics, the following data collection tools help simplify event tracking, provide deeper insights, and allow effortless data sharing. It's a practical way to ensure you're well-informed about your event's performance and armed with meaningful insights.\n\n\n\n1.

Social media analytics tools\n\n\n\nSocial media analytics unwrap the mystery behind your online presence, revealing who's talking about your event, what's getting shared, and which posts are turning heads. To gauge your audience's enthusiasm for your content, you can check out your engagement metrics (such as likes, shares, and comments) directly on each social media platform. Keep a close watch on your content's reach to see just how far your event's message is traveling across social platforms.\n\n\n\nYou can also recruit third-party tools like&nbsp;Hootsuite&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sprout Social&nbsp;to help you deep dive into your insights at a glance. Social media analytics take you from just uploading a post to strategically crafting content that better resonates with your followers, making your event's online presence louder than ever.\n\n\n\n3. Web analytics platforms\n\n\n\nA web analytics platform reveals the behavioral patterns of your website visitors, shedding light on how they discovered your site, what content resonates, and how they navigate your event's landing page.&nbsp;As an option, Google Analytics 4&nbsp;is a tool that empowers you to delve into your website traffic, user demographics, and most popular pages, giving you valuable insights into your attendees' interests.\n\n\n\nTo make this even easier, tools like&nbsp;Hotjar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Crazy Egg&nbsp;offer visual heatmaps and user session recordings, providing a front-row seat to visitor interactions and pain points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4.

Whether it's for pitching to prospective&nbsp;event sponsors&nbsp;or keeping your hardworking&nbsp;event staff&nbsp;in the loop, data presented right can be a game-changer! Charts, graphs, and tables can be your trusty tools for showcasing trends and insights. Add comparisons and benchmarks to give your data context, as well as use color coding and clear labels.&nbsp;LookerStudio&nbsp;can help you easily make your visualizations appealing to the eye and easy to understand.\n\n\n\nLeveraging event analytics to make informed decisions\n\n\n\nYou've got the ultimate toolkit at your fingertips for growing your events \u2013 analytics! This information can be a clear indicator of what your next step should be to amp up your event. Think about attendance metrics. If you notice fewer people showing up than expected, it's a nudge to rethink your&nbsp;event marketing&nbsp;game or maybe shuffle your event's timing. Your conversion metrics can provide insight into what strategies turn leads into sales, letting you know which efforts to push. For engagement, if there's high app usage, you may want to direct more resources to enhance the app experience.\n\n\n\nThe trick lies in using this data as a compass.

If you're ready to face your biggest fears and experience new horrors untold, New York has some seriously scary attractions you need to check out this Halloween. From haunted hayrides, to terror trails, to eerie asylums, here are eight of the most frightening experiences in the Empire State.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Hills Asylum\n\n\n\nEast Bethany, NY\n\n\n\nRolling Hills Asylum&nbsp;is the perfect place for those brave enough to explore the paranormal. Rated as one of the most haunted places in the U.S., Rolling Hills Asylum is known for its real-life hauntings. Take a guided tour of the asylum and listen to the stories of others who have walked before you. Or set out on your own paranormal adventure during a private ghost hunt. Take a deep breath, grab your flashlight, and prepare to experience true paranormal activity \u2013 if you dare.\u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleepy Hollow Haunted Hayride\n\n\n\nSleepy Hollow, NY\n\n\n\nTest your courage (and sanity) at the&nbsp;Village of Sleepy Hollow's Haunted Hayride. For over 10 years, people have traveled from all over to climb aboard one of their hayrides for a spine-chilling adventure through the dark woods, full of the ghastly creatures and wayworn monsters that usually hide under your bed. In fact, you'll follow the exact path Ichabod Crane took while fleeing the headless Horseman in Sleepy Hollow. Too afraid to ride? Fear not! There's also a block party with live music, vendors, and family-friendly activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyracuse Walk of the Dead\n\n\n\nLiverpool, NY\n\n\n\nTake a walk on some of the most terrifying trails New York has to offer at the&nbsp;Syracuse Walk of the Dead.

Work up the nerve to make your way through the dark corridors of the Haunted Hallways and face off against the scares that are waiting around every corner. As you travel through the Sinister Estate, you'll find yourself awaiting the doctor's order for brutal mistreatment in the Asylum. Will you make it out alive or become the very thing you fear the most?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Matter Scream Works\n\n\n\nRochester, NY\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for a truly memorable fright, check out&nbsp;Dark Matter Scream Works, an indoor attraction with five different haunted houses.

With three of the original stone buildings still standing today, this property dates back to the early 1800s.

If you have a passion for puzzles, a taste for suspense, and a knack for hosting unforgettable events, then organizing a murder mystery is the perfect choice for you. In these six steps, learn how to host a murder mystery dinner party that'll have your guests on the edge of their seats!\n\n\n\nWhat is a murder mystery dinner?\n\n\n\nA murder mystery dinner party is a themed dinner revolving around a role-playing mystery game, where those in attendance try to figure out who's secretly the murderer. It's a perfect mystery game for adults who want to immerse themselves in a suspenseful storyline and work together to solve a spooky whodunit. This type of event is particularly popular around Halloween, although this could easily be hosted any time of year.\n\n\n\nNow, let's cut to the chase and uncover the secrets of&nbsp;how to plan&nbsp;a murder mystery party.\n\n\n\n1. Plan your story\n\n\n\nThe story of your murder mystery is the lifeblood of your spooky event. To get you started, you can pick your plot line in one of these two ways:\n\n\n\nPurchase a murder mystery kit\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for a foolproof way to host a murder mystery dinner party (especially if it's your first time), then purchasing a&nbsp;murder mystery kit&nbsp;is a great place to start! These kits are carefully designed to create an engaging experience right out of the box. Inside, you'll find character profiles, intriguing clues, scripts, and step-by-step instructions to help you effortlessly navigate the entire event. Choose from a wide variety of themes with plenty of unique roles for everyone interested in playing.\n\n\n\nCreate your own murder mystery&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWant to add a unique flair to your murder mystery? Crafting your own story grants you extra creative freedom, particularly when choosing your event's theme and characters. This is an especially perfect option if you're a theater or musical organization planning to use your own actors.\n\n\n\nTo get started, brainstorm a compelling plot with twists and turns that'll keep everyone guessing. Create detailed character profiles, including backgrounds, motives, and secrets, to help your mystery's participants (whether that's your attendees or a designated cast) bring their characters to life. Develop clues and evidence that lead to the big reveal, and ensure your talented actors are well-rehearsed with scripts or prompts to guide their interactions during the dinner party. If you're looking for some extra inspiration, check out scripts online to help you get started with fresh ideas!&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Set the stage\n\n\n\nBased on your theme, decorate the space with props like crime scene tape, vintage photographs, or mysterious artifacts. Enhance the ambiance with dimmed lighting or candlelit tables to create an atmosphere of suspense. Consider playing themed background music, burning a specific aroma throughout the night, or keeping the room at a brisk temperature for a bone-chilling experience. You can even select a venue that aligns with the theme of your murder mystery (like an old historic building or a cozy cabin) for an extra layer of magic to your event. To add to the immersive atmosphere, encourage your guests to dress up according to the theme too. If you're using your own actors for the show, they could even pretend to be a part of the audience and later reveal themselves for a wild surprise once the story starts!\n\n\n\n3. Spread the word\n\n\n\nCaptivate your guests from the start with an eye-catching&nbsp;event page&nbsp;and a proper invitation. Use a ticketing platform like TicketLeap to effortlessly create custom event pages that match the theme of your murder mystery and get people excited to buy their tickets. Then, send out alluring&nbsp;email invitations&nbsp;to your prospective guests, complete with your full event details and spooky graphics. TicketLeap is full of additional&nbsp;haunt ticketing features&nbsp;that'll make it easy for you to also send any necessary waivers or registration forms to your ticket buyers before they get to the crime scene.\n\n\n\n4. Serve a themed dinner\n\n\n\nAligning the menu of your event with the theme of your event is key to mastering how to plan a murder mystery dinner. Incorporate dishes that reflect the time period or setting of your murder mystery. For example, if you're hosting a 1920's theme, impress your guests with classic cocktails like martinis or old fashioneds. To add an extra layer of intrigue, label the dishes with creative names tied to the storyline like \"Poisoned Pear Salad\" or \"Fatal Fettuccine Alfredo.\" Consider asking about potential dietary restrictions in your event's&nbsp;registration questions&nbsp;as well. That way, you can accommodate those guests and ensure everyone gets to enjoy your delicious meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Assign your characters\n\n\n\nIf you're planning to have attendees participate in the mystery itself, you can use the information you gathered from your registration form to assign the perfect character to each of them. Once you've done this, it's important to send out character assignments as soon as possible (ideally 2-4 weeks in advance). This gives them ample time to read up on their characters and understand their backgrounds, motives, and secrets. They may even find a costume that matches their character's personality. If you're using your own actors, you should still share character information with your attendees beforehand. This helps them get familiar with the story and start thinking about who the true suspect might be.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Solve the mystery!\n\n\n\nAs the night unfolds and tension builds, it's time to put your detective skills to the test and solve the murder mystery at your dinner party. Encourage your guests to interact, question suspects, and gather clues to piece together the puzzle. Try incorporating a voting system where guests can cast their votes on who they believe is the culprit. Finally, at the grand reveal, announce the true identity of the murderer and congratulate those who solved the mystery. Award prizes for the most astute detective or the best-dressed character to add an extra element of friendly competition. Don't forget to take&nbsp;event photos&nbsp;and videos throughout the night to capture the excitement! Afterwards, you can share these highlights to your social media and use them when&nbsp;marketing your future spooky events.\n\n\n\nYour murder mystery awaits \u2014 let TicketLeap\u00a0be your partner in crime!

Read on to learn everything you need to know about chargebacks, TicketLeap's efforts to win them for you, and some strategies to mitigate them from the get-go.\n\n\n\nWhat are chargebacks?\n\n\n\nA chargeback occurs when a buyer disputes a charge to their account directly with their credit card company. In regards to your event, ticket buyers would typically claim that they didn't authorize the purchase, or that they didn't receive the experience they were promised. While some chargebacks are filed shortly following a transaction, they can be filed up to four months after a purchase! The most common types of chargeback disputes in the events industry include:\n\n\n\n1. Fraudulent purchases\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims someone stole their credit card and used it to buy tickets. Bigger attractions like haunted houses, festivals, and concerts tend to face more of this activity.\n\n\n\n2. Services not rendered\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims they bought tickets but never redeemed them or attended your event.\n\n\n\n3. Duplicate processing\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims they were charged twice for the same order of tickets or merchandise.\n\n\n\n4. Credit not processed\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims they canceled or returned their purchased tickets but have not yet received a refund.\n\n\n\n5. Not as described or defective\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims the goods\/services they received didn't match your event's description.\n\n\n\nHow TicketLeap addresses every chargeback claim\n\n\n\nUnlike other ticketing companies, TicketLeap has a full-time risk manager whose main responsibility is to manage the chargeback process, address every single chargeback,&nbsp;and provide as much evidence as possible for the best chance at winning each case. Because of these efforts, we have successfully won over 50% of chargeback claims filed \u2013 nearly 20% above the&nbsp;industry average&nbsp;win rate of 32%! So rest assured, your events are in good hands with us.\n\n\n\nFrom initial claim to seeing the money back in your account, disputing a chargeback can take between 45 to 90 days. After the cardholder initially contacts their bank, we (your ticketing provider) receive a notice that the dispute has been filed and have 30 days to respond. We first determine if the filer has a legitimate claim. For example, they may have had their card stolen and deserve a refund. If the claim doesn't seem legitimate, however, our team notifies the event organizer about each chargeback and provides the buyer's name, the dispute reason, and their order information. Organizers are then encouraged to reach out to buyers directly if they feel the chargeback has been filed in error.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf the event organizer and customer aren't able to come to an agreement, we'll move forward with disputing the chargeback by putting a case together to fight it. During this process, we must confirm the filer actually bought tickets and attended the event, and send proof that demonstrates the dispute doesn't have a strong enough case to merit a chargeback. This can be anything from scan logs with timestamps, to&nbsp;event photos&nbsp;customers may have posted on social media. Once the evidence is submitted to the bank, the case will remain open for approximately 45 days before a ruling happens. If the case is won, TicketLeap (and you!) retains the revenue. If the case is lost, the funds are withdrawn from TicketLeap and given back to the cardholder.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow event organizers can prevent chargebacks\n\n\n\nWhile TicketLeap works around the clock to help you prevent chargebacks, there's also a few actions you can take to stop them in their tracks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Have buyers sign your refund policy\n\n\n\nAsking your ticket buyers to sign an event waiver and refund policy ensures they understand how you handle refunds and what to expect from your event. This policy gives you clear evidence to challenge any chargebacks in the future.\n\n\n\n2. Scan tickets at the gate\n\n\n\nRedeeming tickets at the door provides you with key evidence to help fight fraud, as it shows who entered your event and who didn't. Later, you can pull up any attendee from your scan logs if they claim they never attended.\n\n\n\n3. Require ID and credit card verification\n\n\n\nVerify your ticket buyers' identities by requiring them to show the credit card they used to purchase as well as their IDs to ensure that those entering your venue are who they say they are.\n\n\n\n4. Have onsite staff monitor for suspicious activity\n\n\n\nAssign a couple staff members to patrol the admissions line, using multiple iPads to check in and verify attendees up and down the line so that all they have to do at the gate is scan their tickets. In doing so, it will help keep the wait times down and allows your staff to be on the lookout for scalpers trying to resell tickets to others in line.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Turn off ticket sales prior to your event's start time\n\n\n\nBecause fraudsters will try to buy tickets as close to your event as possible, be sure to close online ticket sales prior to your event's start time and only sell tickets at the box office on event day. A good rule of thumb is to turn off online ticket sales 24 hours before the start of your event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Review large ticket orders\n\n\n\nLarge orders (typically eight or more tickets) are more likely to involve fraudulent activity like scalping because the buyer can resell those tickets in bulk to make a quick profit. When monitoring orders, look out for fake email addresses, unusual names, billing addresses that don't match (especially locations far away from your event), and duplicate emails or names on multiple orders.\n\n\n\n7. Reach out to buyers with suspected fraudulent orders\n\n\n\nIf you do suspect fraudulent activity, contact the ticket buyer directly and say you'll refund the order unless you hear otherwise in the next 48 hours. If it was a genuine mistake, they'll let you know.\n\n\n\nChargebacks aren't fun for anyone, so it's important to have a trusted team fighting them for you. With TicketLeap on your side, you'll have the peace of mind to focus on planning and selling tickets to your next big event. With a dedicated team ready to challenge every chargeback, no other ticketing company fights for you as hard as TicketLeap does!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/62d011c7978ce8d8d48cec70_tl-chargeback-optimized-scaled-1-1024x287.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

You've come to the right place! In between attending classes and studying for exams, college students are always looking for new, fun experiences to enjoy with their friends. To help you create your next college event, our experts have put together a list of must-attend events that are sure to be the talk around campus and give students plenty of memories for long after graduation.\n\n\n\nTypes of college events perfect year-round\n\n\n\n1. \"Stuff-a-Plush\" events\n\n\n\nNot only does \u201cStuff-a-Plush\u201d offer a unique activity for your student body to do with their friends, it also gives them a cute keepsake to bring back to their dorm. At this event, give out unstuffed plushies for students to fill with stuffing and seal up themselves for an added personal touch. Pick a theme, like animals or food, and offer different plushies based around that. You can even encourage them to register ahead of time to guarantee they'll get the plushie they want. Host events like this throughout the year, especially around the holidays, so that students can bring one home as a gift to a family member or loved one!\n\n\n\n2. On-campus concerts\n\n\n\nGive students the chance to jam out to their favorite bands and artists within walking distance from their dorms! Host a range of performances from local talent to celebrity artists (depending on your budget) as either special one-time events or as part of a semester-long concert series. When students register on your concert's event page, be sure to include a survey to discover who they hope comes to campus next, so you can book performers you know will bring in excited fans!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Film festival\n\n\n\nLights, camera, action! There's nothing like a film festival to bring together students who share a passion for cinema. From documentaries to animations, it's all about celebrating indie films created by your current students, or even by alumni. Premiere these movies in a theater on campus, like in your student center, and even have a red carpet into the entrance for students as they arrive. As one of your cultural event ideas to enlighten your student body and nurture further conversations, you could even set up a Q&amp;A panel after the films for people to ask the creators themselves about the stories behind their masterpieces. So why not grab some popcorn and settle in for a night of cinematic adventures with your fellow movie buffs? Who knows, you might even be watching the next big blockbuster before anyone else!\n\n\n\n4. Comedy nights\n\n\n\nLooking for the perfect college event to break the ice and get your students laughing together? Host a comedy night! It's a great way to lighten the mood and encourage students to come together for some good old belly laughs. From stand-up acts to improv showdowns, there\u2019s no end to the fun. Plus, it\u2019s a brilliant opportunity for budding comedians on campus to strut their stuff. Invite your students to the stage, crack some jokes, and watch as the room fills with laughter \u2013 making it a night to remember!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Video game tournaments\n\n\n\nLevel up your university life with something totally epic: a video game tournament! In the growing world of esports, this is the perfect opportunity to bring together students who love gaming and friendly competition. Set up different consoles or PCs with popular games like Valorant, Overwatch, or Super Smash Bros and let the battles begin! Bring together teams from different student organizations, majors, or even across other college campuses to compete for various prizes like a brand new gaming console or a cash prize.\n\n\n\n6. Silent disco\n\n\n\nImagine this: a dance floor bustling with energy, yet not a single beat heard out loud. Welcome to the world of silent disco! For this super fun event, each guest gets their own set of headphones, tuning into music that's DJ-ed live. Get lost in the music and dance like nobody's watching (because they're all in their own musical world). It's a surefire way to create a buzz on campus, bring people together, and make some noise (quietly, of course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Karaoke night\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love singing along to their favorite songs? Putting on a karaoke night is a fan-favorite college event that allows everyone to let loose and have some fun. Simply rent a karaoke machine or even just set up a microphone, speakers, and a screen to play the lyrics on (and maybe even a projector to get more students engaged and singing along). If you want to go a step further, you could throw a friendly competition for the best performance or encourage students to dress up as their favorite artists (Elvis anyone?).\n\n\n\nThis event is sure to bring out the star in everyone and uncover some hidden talents (or at least, enthusiastic attempts). And be sure to capture the best performances for your college's social media! Whether you're a shower singer or the next big thing, it's all about enriching your university life with college event ideas like this to have a blast with friends.\n\n\n\n8. Scavenger hunt\n\n\n\nReady for an adventure that'll take your students on a wild ride across campus, uncovering clues and solving puzzles with friends? Put together a scavenger hunt and turn your campus into a treasure map! Not only will it get students active and moving, but scavenger hunts also encourage teamwork and critical thinking skills. Create clues that lead to various locations around campus until the final treasure is found. This is a great idea for building school spirit as students learn more about historic places on your campus they might not have otherwise known about. Add some hidden goodies through your scavenger hunt for an extra incentive and watch as students race to be the first ones to finish!\n\n\n\n9. Dorm decor crafts\n\n\n\nCraft workshops are a perfect opportunity for new students to make new friends while creating fun decorations for their dorm! Who doesn't want to personalize their room to match their unique personality and aesthetic? For example, they could build their own potted plants or mini terrariums with fake or real plants. They can make string art for their wall with just wooden boards, some nails, a hammer, and colored string. Or they can let their imaginations run wild as they hand paint wooden pencil holders for their desk, express themselves on a blank canvas, or put together a vision board of their personal goals. The possibilities are endless!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Trivia nights\n\n\n\nEver thought about jazzing up those regular college nights with something super fun? Try hosting a trivia night as one of your university events! At these types of cultural events, test your students' knowledge on anything from popular movies to everything Taylor Swift to the latest in college sports. You could host a monthly trivia night with a different themed topic each time and prizes tied to that theme as well. So, bring your students together, pick a popular theme, and let the trivia battles begin!\n\n\n\n11. Open mics\n\n\n\nShine a spotlight on all the raw talent in your student body with an open mic night! It's the perfect platform to invite students to share their talents. To help ensure your open mic runs smoothly, you can have students use your powerful ticketing platform to register beforehand for their desired time slot. Otherwise, they can wait to sign up for their time slot when they get there. Whether it's soulful poetry, side-splitting comedy, or acoustic jams, an open mic night is bound to bring your community together as they perform for their fellow students.\n\n\n\n12. Ping-pong ball drop\n\n\n\nIt's simple: pick the tallest building on your campus and drop buckets of ping pong balls from it. Pretty straightforward, right? But wait, there's more! There are two ways to spice up this game. First, set up a target on the ground close to where you'll be dropping the balls from. Then have students write their names on a select number of ping pong balls for the chance to win cash prizes, gift cards, or other bonuses if they're one of the closest to that target.\n\n\n\nAs a second idea, put specially marked ping pong balls into the mix beforehand. As you drop all the balls from the building, students can stand under the shower of ping pong balls (with or without an umbrella) and collect the specially marked ones to win a prize! Whether you're on&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;TikTok, or&nbsp;Facebook, this experience will make for some great content for your school's social media pages too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Sports tournaments\n\n\n\nOrganizing an intramural sports tournament at your school is another great way to engage students and build school spirit! This could be a one-day event or spread out over the course of a week, depending on the number of teams and types of sports involved. You can choose to focus on traditional team sports such as basketball, soccer, or volleyball, or mix it up with some more unique options like ultimate frisbee, kickball, or even an obstacle course race. If you're looking to expand beyond traditional sports, consider hosting a field day or mini Olympics with various activities like tug of war, relay races, and even a water balloon toss.\n\n\n\nUsing your ticketing platform for people to sign up, students from each campus organization could register their teams to play against each other. You could have specific tournaments for graduate students or a friendly rivalry between senior students and other classes. To make sure everyone feels included, you can also have different divisions for different skill levels or allow students to sign up individually and form new teams with their peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of outdoor event ideas for college students\n\n\n\n14. Outdoor festivals\n\n\n\nKick off or wrap up the semester with a campus-wide outdoor festival. Get students excited by promoting unique headlining activities, like a bull ride simulator, an&nbsp;inflatable obstacle course, a zipline, or anything else they don't get to experience every day! Plus, if you offer free food and good music, students will find themselves drawn to the festivities and inviting their friends, too. Have students&nbsp;register online&nbsp;beforehand with their student ID and shirt size for a (free) exclusive festival t-shirt to drive even more traffic to your event and give you a better idea of how many students will be attending. With unique activities and free fun galore, your festival is bound to be the buzz around campus!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Outdoor movie nights\n\n\n\nNothing says summer like watching a movie under the stars! Set up a projector and screen in an open area on campus and invite students to bring blankets, pillows, and snacks for a cozy night of entertainment. You can choose popular blockbusters or have themed nights based on student votes. Is there rain in the forecast? Rather than canceling your event, you could always watch the movie in your student center. It\u2019s the perfect way to kick back, relax, and enjoy some quality time outside the lecture halls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16. One-day hiking adventure\n\n\n\nHelp switch up your college students' same old routine of going to class, studying, and hanging out on campus with one-off hiking adventures! Partner with your university's recreation center to host organized hikes, mini kayaking trips, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities as a national park, hiking trail, or nature reserve near campus. It's the perfect opportunity for team building, making new friends, and getting to explore areas that students may have never been before \u2013 from serene lakes to towering forests.\n\n\n\n17. Bonfires\n\n\n\nGather around a crackling fire with some marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers for one of the best summer social event ideas for university students! Bonfires are the perfect way to bring students together and get to know each other better. You can even add in some extra fun activities like ghost stories or group games to keep the night going. Make sure to check with your university about any fire codes or regulations before planning this event. Verify that your campus allows bonfires and ensure a staff member supervises it constantly. Additionally, it's important to check your state and city's open burn regulations, along with any local laws about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Barn parties\n\n\n\nTime to bust out the cowboy hats and overalls! Hosted in an actual barn or transformed space on campus, these parties can include hayrides, live music, and good ol' square dancing. They offer a rustic and laid-back atmosphere for people to socialize (especially new students!) and have barrels of fun. Consider adding some themed decorations and other activities like putting up a mini petting zoo, bobbing for apples, or even renting out a mechanical bull for this rowdy campus event. Don't forget to provide plenty of food and drinks, including some classic farm-inspired dishes like BBQ, corn on the cob, and apple cider.\n\n\n\n19. Hot air balloon rides\n\n\n\nUp, up, and away! Take in the breathtaking views of your campus and surrounding areas while floating high above the ground in a hot air balloon ride. Whether it's a solo adventure or one with a group of friends, college students will love the chance to make unforgettable memories and check off an item from their bucket list. Plus, it's a unique way to see the campus from a different perspective and appreciate its beauty. As one of the more involved college events, you could get local businesses to sponsor the ride, including letting them set up a tent near where students line up for the balloon ride, giving them ample shoutouts, or include their information in a swag bag for students. You could even turn the event into a full-blown festival with food trucks, inflatables, free t-shirts, and more! This college campus event is sure to be the talk of the semester!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoliday events for college students\n\n\n\n20. Fall festival\n\n\n\nLooking for some college event ideas to host this fall? Try hosting a fall festival for your college students! Decorate the quad or main gathering area with hay bales, pumpkins, and autumn decorations to set the scene. You could have food trucks and local vendors selling seasonal treats like apple cider and pumpkin spice lattes. Plus, you should plan fun activities like bobbing for apples, pumpkin carving contests, and corn hole tournaments. This is a great way to help get incoming students involved and celebrate the changing seasons!\n\n\n\n21. Pumpkin carving\n\n\n\nNothing says Halloween more than some spooky jack o' lanterns! As one of your fun events on campus for Halloween, set up some pumpkins for students to carve or paint to their hearts' content. Not only is it a creative way to get into the Halloween spirit, but it also allows students to express themselves and gives them a chance to get together with friends. You can even make it into a contest and have students vote on their favorite pumpkin for a prize!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22. Murder mystery dinner\n\n\n\nLooking for some unique social event ideas to kick off the Halloween season? Try hosting a murder mystery dinner! This fun and interactive event will have students solving a spooky crime while enjoying a delicious (free!) meal together. You can either hire a professional company to run the event or create your own murder mystery storyline with the help of your student body (like college students in your theater department). You can use your ticketing platform to send an invitation email with all the details, including encouraging attendees to dress up in their best detective or suspect attire for an even more immersive experience.\n\n\n\n23. Ice skating\n\n\n\nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced skater, hitting the ice rink with friends is always a fun event around Christmas! Rent a synthetic ice rink for students to skate in and set it up on a large, flat area of your campus grounds. Then, students could arrive bundled up and ready to skate, either by renting skates from the rink or bringing their own. You can even make it more interesting for your students by hosting themed nights, like \"Ugly Sweater Skating\" or \"Skating in Pajamas.\" After that, you can provide a hot cocoa bar and snacks to warm back up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24. Gingerbread house competition\n\n\n\nWant to spice up the festive season with a little competitive spirit? A gingerbread house competition is a perfect excuse for your college students to let their creativity flow as they gear up for the holidays. Picture heaps of icing, mountains of gumdrops, and stacks of gingerbread, all coming together in a cozy, laughter-filled room. You could provide small gingerbread house kits for students, or let them build their own creations from scratch. Graham crackers are also a cost effective option! Once they're done, let people vote for their favorites! It\u2019s a sweet way to de-stress during exam season!\n\n\n\n25. Galentines' day\n\n\n\nWho says Valentine's Day is only for couples? Celebrate friendship and love by hosting a Galentine's day as one of your Valentine's Day ideas for college students. Have attendees bring their favorite dish to share, whether it's heart-shaped pancakes or heart-shaped fruit skewers. You could set up a chocolate bar too complete with a chocolate fountain to dip strawberries, marshmallows, and other delicious treats into. Play a rom com in the background to snuggle up with some cozy blankets to watch (wearing pajamas is encouraged!). Make sure to have pink heart decorations and set up some games to add to the fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health events for finals week\n\n\n\n26. Donut stress\n\n\n\nAs a sweet way to curb that nagging test anxiety, put together a \u201cDonut Stress\u201d event with free donuts. Get students excited amidst the stress of exams by also offering additional types of sweet treats, coffee, mini massages, and more. College can be stressful, so why not take a break and pamper yourself? This is definitely among some of the most popular college social events ideas for finals week and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27. Mediation workshops\n\n\n\nHosting events throughout exam week to help students refresh and recharge can be the perfect boost they need to finish that paper or ace that test. Give students strategies to better decompress and promote more balance in campus life. You could organize this as an in person event or make it an online session for students to register for. This can be a great way to introduce students to the benefits of self-care and mindfulness, while also providing them with valuable tools for managing stress during finals week.\n\n\n\n28. Yoga sessions\n\n\n\nSimilar to mediation workshops, hosting yoga sessions can also be a super effective way to help students relieve stress and anxiety during finals week. You could partner with a local yoga studio or have a certified instructor lead the session on campus. Invite students to bring their own mats and promote people to attend events like this as an opportunity for them to take a break from studying and focus on their physical and mental well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29. Late-night breakfast bar\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love breakfast food? Organizing a midnight breakfast during finals week is not only a fun social event, but it also provides students with free food and a study break. Set up stations at a late-night breakfast bar with pancakes, coffee, cereal, and more to fuel them up for their next all-nighter. Consider partnering with local restaurants or coffee shops to offer a wider variety of options and support small businesses in the process.\n\n\n\n30. Play with puppies\n\n\n\nWhat better way to bring students together than with puppies? Invite some service dogs in training for students to play with and remind them of their furry friends at home. Let your college students take these dogs on a quick walk around campus, play tug o' war with them, or just enjoy petting the various fluffy canines there. They'll appreciate the excuse for a study break! Not only that, but this could be an important opportunity for them to learn about the importance of service animals and how they can support their community by volunteering with local animal organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege events to drive community engagement\n\n\n\n31. Thrifting event\n\n\n\nHost a thrifting event that's all about sustainable fashion and scoring some awesome finds! With help from your local community, fill this thrifting day with racks of unique, gently-used clothing where college students can hunt for their next favorite outfit or that vintage gem they didn't know they needed. It's the perfect way to refresh their wardrobe on a small budget, all while keeping it eco-friendly. Plus, it's a fantastic opportunity to meet fellow fashion-forward students and share style tips.\n\n\n\n32. Charity run\n\n\n\nLace up your running shoes for a good cause! Hosting a charity run around your campus is bound to bring people together in a welcoming college town to rally around supporting nonprofits in your community. It\u2019s the perfect way to spread some positivity, encourage a bit of healthy competition, and, most importantly, raise money for a local charity close to everyone\u2019s hearts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33. Blood drive\n\n\n\nGive the gift of life by organizing a blood drive on campus! Partner with a local blood bank and spread awareness about the importance of donating blood. Not only will this event bring students together for a good cause, but it could also save lives in the process. For students who are able to donate blood at these charity events, offering a variety of prizes such as gift vouchers, exclusive university merchandise, or even free coffee vouchers can serve as great incentives. It'd be thoughtful to offer some free food for them after they're done donating blood as well.\n\n\n\n34. Farmers' market\n\n\n\nLet students browse local vendors from the community for fresh fruit and vegetables, bouquets of flowers, and other locally grown items. You'll not only offering a unique shopping opportunity to your college students, but supporting local restaurants and farmers too! Set up a station where students can even arrange their own beautiful flower bouquet! Like a traditional farmers' market, consider including vendors at your campus farmer's market who sell handcrafted jewelry, art, or clothing as well. Pick a scenic, open spot on campus so it's accessible to everyone (no public transportation needed!) all the time. This market is one event that students won't want to miss!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35. Community service events\n\n\n\nOrganizing community service events is an awesome way to help your students make a real difference in your local area. Whether it\u2019s a park cleanup, volunteering at a local shelter, or being a local charity auction host, there\u2019s something for everyone. Plus, it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for students to step out of their comfort zones, meet new friends, and gain valuable experience for their professional goals as well. Whether it's to raise money for a local nonprofit, donate goods to a shelter, or volunteer some time to help those in need, community service provides powerful college event ideas to develop important skills in your students.\n\n\n\nEducational college events to invite students to\n\n\n\n36. Career fairs\n\n\n\nA career fair not only helps your students kickstart their futures but also brings together vibrant minds and industry leaders under one roof! Imagine creating an event where connections are made and dreams are sparked, all while supporting local businesses. Whether it's in a bustling campus hall or a series of online events, a career fair could be the perfect way to give back, share insights, and maybe even discover the next big talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37. Seminars on professional and life skills\n\n\n\nIn today's competitive job market, employers are looking for well-rounded individuals with strong soft skills as well as technical qualifications. That's why hosting seminars on topics such as time management, communication, leadership, and networking can greatly benefit your students. You could also host workshops to teach students about various practical skills like budgeting, investing, and resume building that'll prepare your students in the long run as well. These events will not only provide valuable knowledge but also help them develop the essential skills needed to succeed in their future careers!\n\n\n\n38. Headshot sessions\n\n\n\nAs students enter the workforce, having a professional headshot can make a big difference in their job search! These types of college events are the perfect way to help prepare your students for the workforce. Offer quick headshot sessions at your university to help them stand out from other candidates. You could partner with local photographers or even have a photography club on campus run these sessions for their peers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39. Guest speakers\n\n\n\nInvite guest speakers to share their personal stories, inspirational talks, and worldly advice to students on important topics that are relevant to them today. Promote these campus events as your college's local TED Talk or late night talk show hosted by a notable faculty member. These events can be for specific major departments or for the entire university depending on the community members, speakers, and alumni you draw in. Plus, if you have the budget, consider hosting celebrities or social media influencers, as they're sure to draw in a big crowd. Remember to add a Q&amp;A session at the end so students can engage in discussions with your speakers as well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n40. Cooking classes\n\n\n\nHosting a cooking class is a great way for young adults to make new friends while developing practical skills they'll carry with them for the rest of their lives. Invite guest instructors from around campus or from the local restaurant community to host a class and share various cooking tips and tricks. These class levels can range from beginner to advanced, and teach students to make a wide variety of dishes throughout the semester. You can even personalize the courses for Thanksgiving side dishes, Christmas cookies, and more around the holidays. Soon, they'll be making delicious food for all their friends and family!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41. Coffee connect with alumni\n\n\n\nWhat better way to open doors for your students' careers than by connecting them with former students who graduated with the same major? As one of the especially important event ideas for college graduates, this program would provide students the opportunity to chat with alumni over coffee and gain valuable advice about their future careers. This can be done through small group coffee meetups, one-on-one mentorship sessions, or even turn these into virtual events to meet out-of-state alumni. This would not only let students network and gain valuable insights into the job market, but could also open potential opportunities for internships or jobs after graduation!\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\n\nNow, take your favorite college event ideas and run with them! And consider using an intuitive ticketing platform to help you register students and sell out tickets to all your events. With&nbsp;TicketLeap, you'll get free access to all the features you need to keep in touch with students who sign up for your events, manage attendance, and host incredible experiences that will bring your campus to life!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/62a8e9a50f19b73012512a91_college-students-hanging-out-on-campus-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":97,"name":"Event Ideas","slug":"event-ideas","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":97,"taxonomy":"category","description":"<span data-sheets-root=\"1\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Let TicketLeap help you brainstorm for your next awesome event!

Don't worry, we've got your back! Writing a compelling email invitation can help boost your ticket sales and add a personal touch to your marketing strategy. Read on for our team's tips on how to write an effective event email invitation that'll have your attendees counting down to your big day.\n\n\n\nThe audience of your invitations\n\n\n\nBefore we deep dive into how to write your emails, you'll need to determine what audience you're writing to. More specifically, are you writing to prospective attendees or returning guests? This distinction will help you create invitations in a way that best resonates with them. For first-timers, ensure your branding and logo are clearly displayed to establish your organization as a trusted source. For returning guests, try offering an exclusive discount or early access to tickets as a way of saying thank you for showing their support or referring a friend. Keep these differences in mind as you craft each email invitation for event-goers, and your event will be one they can't resist!\n\n\n\nThe 5 key ingredients of your invitation email\n\n\n\nNow that you know who you're writing to, let's discuss how to best write each element of a successful event invite email:\n\n\n\n1. Subject line\n\n\n\nSince this is the first piece of text that people will see, your event email subject lines make a big difference in whether they open your email or not. You want it to be catchy and to the point, ideally nine words or less. Throwing in an emoji or two can also help grab their attention. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\"Ready to Party? \ud83c\udf89 Join Us at Scottfield's New Year's Gala!\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't Miss 2023 Sporting Conference's Award-Winning Speakers! \ud83e\udd29\"\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these examples include a benefit of attending and the event name, while remaining both exciting and brief. Subject lines can also create a sense of urgency with phrases such as \u201cAct Fast!\u201d or \u201cDon't Miss Out!\u201d (like in the second example).\n\n\n\nAnother best practice is to personalize the subject line with the recipient's name (e.g., \u201cHi Rachel, You're Invited!\u201d) to add an even more personal touch to your message. You should also try out different subject lines with&nbsp;A\/B testing&nbsp;and see which ones get the most clicks. Give it a go and see what works best for your event!\n\n\n\n2. Headline\n\n\n\nNow that you've crafted an effective subject line for your event invitation email, it's time to focus on your headline. A headline is the title within your email (just above the main text) that works hand in hand with your subject line. Instead of repeating what you already said in the subject line, use this text to shine the spotlight on other details about your event that'll peak your reader's interest. Plus, you want your headline to naturally flow into the body of your email. For instance, if you were hosting a beer festival, the headline \u201cTap Into a World of Flavor on June 20th!\" would be the perfect headline for the subject line \u201cAdam, You're Invited to the Copperridge Brew Fest! \ud83c\udf7b\u201d.\n\n\n\n3. Email copy\n\n\n\nWhen writing the body of your email, first things first, make sure to place all the important details near the top. This includes your date, time, location, and duration of your event. That way, it'll be easy to find this info later without having to scroll through your email. Keep your message short and sweet, highlighting the value of attending your event in a way that's easy to digest. Highlight the featured activities you have lined up, your roster of special guests, or any&nbsp;additional perks they might get for attending. If there's other essential info for your specific event, like a dress code or registration details, this is the place to do so. And remember, depending on who your&nbsp;target audience&nbsp;is, make sure your language and tone of voice speaks directly to them.\n\n\n\n4. Call-to-action\n\n\n\nThis call-to-action (CTA) button prompts the reader to take a specific action, such as \"Buy Tickets\" or \"Subscribe Now.\" You'll want to ensure this action is easy to understand (e.g., click a link, watch a video, buy a ticket). Then, use bold colors, larger sizes, and simple wording so the button itself easily catches the reader's eye. We recommend placing your primary CTA above the fold or just below the text of all your most important event details. Design recognizable links that are underlined or use a contrasting color with hover effects and cursor changes so readers know your CTA is a clickable element.\n\n\n\nAnd be sure to&nbsp;install tracking codes&nbsp;(called UTM parameters) to your links! For your ticketing pages specifically, you can&nbsp;set up Google Analytics&nbsp;or another third-party tracking tool straight to these links using TicketLeap. This will give you valuable information about those who click your CTA to help you assess the effectiveness of each email and conduct remarketing campaigns. You may want to consider having a secondary CTA (like \u201cLearn More\u201d) that provides the reader with more information about your event or organization, should they need some extra persuading before purchasing their tickets.\n\n\n\n5. Design\n\n\n\nDesigning your email invites in a super sleek, engaging way can help win your email recipients over! You should especially highlight your organization's logo, colors, font, and other branding elements throughout the email. That way, you'll build credibility with your readers, increase brand recognition, and create a cohesive look in your invite that's visually appealing. And don't forget to include some high-quality images of your upcoming events to hype up your readers too! Plus, between each section of your invite, you'd be surprised how adding some white space can make your email easier to read, as well as create a sense of balance and structure.\n\n\n\nOne last thing: it's important to remember that most people will be opening your email on their mobile devices, so double check that your design is mobile-friendly. With a ticketing platform like TicketLeap, your emails are automatically optimized for display on smaller screens!\n\n\n\nNow that you're an event invitation email wizard, you'll be creating invites that not only look awesome but also drive conversions. And imagine how easy this is with an intuitive ticketing platform that can manage your email blasts for you!

On top of capturing unforgettable memories, event photography is a powerful tool for curating the perfect promotional materials to sell out events! If you follow our event photography tips, you and your staff will snap awesome photos without needing to budget for a professional photographer. Read on to learn how to take your skills up a notch, using only your phone.\n\n\n\n1. Create a photography shot list&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUsing your event's agenda for reference, put together a shot list that maps out all the key moments throughout the day. Whether it's a guest speaker or an opening act, you'll know when and where to be so you'll capture the perfect shot. This is just a starting point though! While your shot list is a helpful guide, there are plenty of other photos you'll need for your\u00a0Instagram stories\u00a0and other social posts. In between your main event programming, keep your eyes peeled for photo ops of event goers having a blast. This can include your attendees singing along with your artists, picking up delicious food from your vendors, or getting into the competitive spirit while playing lawn games.\n\n\n\n2. Get creative with shots&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow that you've planned out your event photography ideas, make sure you're getting a variety of photos that feel organic and that best represent your event experience, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandid\n\n\n\nSome of the most powerful shots you'll take are organic reactions of your attendees enjoying your event. However, getting these candid photographs is all about timing. Because they're unplanned and capture people fully immersed in the moment, you'll need to keep a keen eye out for these picture-perfect moments!\n\n\n\nPosed\n\n\n\nThroughout your event, find groups of attendees who are ready to strike a pose for an impromptu photoshoot. Be sure to tell them you're part of the event staff and that they might make it on your social media accounts. If you need to help loosen them up in front of the camera, give them a compliment or ask how they're enjoying your event. This will create a more relaxed atmosphere for posed photos and make your guests feel more comfortable!\n\n\n\nBurst\n\n\n\nBurst photos are a great way to capture things that happen in the blink of an eye. For example, if you're hosting a haunted attraction, this feature is perfect for action shots or even a jump scare! To do this on an iPhone, slide the camera button to the left, and it'll immediately start taking photos in burst mode. Android phones can vary, but some allow you to hold down the camera button to start taking burst photos.\n\n\n\nTripod\n\n\n\nA tripod is the tried-and-true method for combating shaky hands to take flawless photos. Simply set up your tripod, get a clear line of sight to your subject, then snap away! This is useful for high res crowd shots, performances at a central location or stage, or low light events like a late night sports game or haunted attraction.\n\n\n\n3. Arrive early&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs an emerging shutterbug who's learning the ropes of photography for events, you'll want to stay on top of your game! Set aside time during your\u00a0pre-event preparations\u00a0to get a lay of the land and make a plan to complete your shot list. Not only will you be able to snap a few shots of the event setup you've worked so hard on, you'll also be ready to photograph your attendees' reactions when they first walk through the gate.\n\n\n\n4. Change perspectives&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWant to add some extra flair to your camera roll? Experimenting with your camera angles can help you to get a more diverse portfolio of photos when shooting events. For example, in addition to taking pictures of attendees, snag some detail shots of what they're doing or where they are. This is especially fitting for more intimate venues like a cooking class or wine tasting. For larger events, be sure to take some aerial shots of an excited crowd or a busy exhibit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Find the right lighting&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember, when it comes to taking professional-looking event photos, good lighting is not just a bright idea, it's a must have! As a golden rule, take advantage of natural light whenever you can. This is especially important if you don't have room in your budget for on-the-go lighting equipment like rings lights. Simply position yourself so the light is in front of your attendees, illuminating them and avoiding unnecessary shadows. If you do need to use flash, don't let your guests feel like a deer in headlights! Angle your camera slightly so the light isn't directly facing them. That way, you'll avoid red eyes from the flash hitting them head-on.\n\n\n\n6. Check your camera settings&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow that you've mastered how to photograph events using burst and flash photos, there's so much more you can do! Spend some time experimenting with your different camera features, like portrait mode, panorama, or high dynamic range (HDR). Want to photograph vivid imagery? HDR can help colors appear more vibrant and capture details in dark lighting. Want to put your attendees in the spotlight? Portrait mode is great for putting your subjects in sharp focus with a blurred background. Need to capture a large group that doesn't quite fit in frame? Panorama shots are the solution. Those are just a few of our favorites, but there's&nbsp;plenty more options&nbsp;to discover!\n\n\n\n7. Utilize the Rule of Thirds\n\n\n\nTake the guesswork out of your framing! Use the&nbsp;Rule of Thirds&nbsp;to perfectly frame your subject and draw viewers in with more dynamic shots. To do this, imagine your image is cut into nine equal squares, like a tic-tac-toe board. Place your subject in the left or right third of your shot while leaving the other two thirds open. This makes your photos more balanced against the background and draws attention to your subject. To make this easier, turn on gridlines in your phone's camera settings to place faint lines over your phone screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Portray a unified message&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember to keep your event's purpose in mind so you can tell a cohesive story through your photos. You want them to perfectly represent your event and tie into your\u00a0event marketing strategy. For example, if you're hosting a local community event, your photos should highlight how you're bringing people together. Even the way you edit your images should fit the feel of your event! If you're hosting a color run, you don't want to post your photos in black and white, right?\n\n\n\n9. Be a fly on the wall\n\n\n\nThe best event photographers are like ninjas \u2013 they're masters of going unnoticed. Your goal should be to take the perfect pictures without distracting from the event or blocking any attendee's view. You may need to be swift in maneuvering around crowds, dress for the occasion without drawing attention to yourself (many photographers opt for an all black outfit), and visualize your plan of action before getting into position. Master the art of blending in, and you'll catch those genuine event moments that attendees will remember for years to come.\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve used our tips for event photography to get tons of new photos, show them off on your next event listing using TicketLeap! Our intuitive ticketing system is packed with easy-to-use features to help create awesome events.

There is so much opportunity to save time and gain valuable insight from your ticket buyers, only using a sign up form is a missed opportunity. With a user-friendly event registration tool or platform, you don't just get one tool \u2014 you get a whole toolbox with all the registration features you need to manage your event from start to finish. Let's take a look at just a few of these top event management tools and what they can do for your event.\n\n\n\nEvent listing builder\n\n\n\nUse your registration platform's template to create a beautiful, custom event page in just a few minutes \u2013 no web design skills required. With an event website, your attendees can find and register for your event online, on any device. Since the listing is customizable, you can include your organization's logo, your brand colors, plus add your own images and videos. If you have more than one event, you can list them all on your online event calendar so all your events are in one place. Attendees will see this calendar as your homepage and can register for multiple events at the same time, with one convenient checkout process.\n\n\n\nEvent promotion and marketing tools\n\n\n\nOnce you've set up your custom event registration page, you now have a link to post on any social media platform to get the word out and increase event registrations. Sharing your event listing with friends via text message or replying to messages on social media, is as easy as copy and paste. Optimize your event management processes by using your platform's email blast feature which will allow you to let your attendees know about important event details and updates. Use a post-purchase message to get your registrants to follow you on other social media platforms or run a contest with an incentive to have them share your online event registration link with their followers. Discount codes are another great promotional tool \u2013 offer loyalty codes to previous buyers, or give local influencers promo codes that they can promote as an exclusive perk to their audiences. Custom ticket types allow you to offer early bird registration discounts or VIP tickets, and custom tickets are also a way to sell merchandise or meals at your specific event.\n\n\n\nSecure credit card payments\n\n\n\nOnline event registration software means you'll need a secure way to accept credit card payments for online ticketing. A top event registration platform integrates the payment processor of your choice into your event registration page, so you can easily sell tickets online. This eliminates the hassle of trying to set up a payment processing system of your own on your site or calling ticket buyers to get their credit card information to complete the purchase. If you're selling tickets at the door, you can accept credit card payments using a credit card swiper and an easy-to-use app on your mobile device. These tools are also great for any merchandise or equipment you'll be selling onsite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports to track event registration and ticket sales\n\n\n\nAs soon as your first attendee registers for your event, your registration platform begins compiling registration data into detailed reports that you can schedule for delivery to your email inbox or view instantly anytime. Get valuable information at a glance \u2013 see sales totals, popular event dates and times, and discount codes used, just to name a few. Use your data reports to measure the success of your event and make your future events bigger and better.\n\n\n\nEvent attendee data collection\n\n\n\nDuring the event registration process, your ticketing platform gathers basic information about your attendees, like names and email addresses. If you need to know a bit more about your audience before your event so you can plan things more thoroughly, your event registration platform can help with that, too. Use a checkout questionnaire to gather information during the event registration form process about anything from t-shirt sizes to dietary needs \u2013 if you've got questions, this is how to get answers.\n\n\n\nEvent day registration and check-in\n\n\n\nThere's more than one way to check in attendees on the day of your event, and a registration platform lets you choose the one that's right for you. Electronic check-in will get your guests in the door faster, which might be the right fit if your event has a larger guest list. If you opt for electronic check-in, you can use your registration platform's app to scan your attendees' tickets (they can print tickets or display them on a mobile device) or look them up by name. Since your platform automatically generates an attendee list of everyone who's registered, you can also print out this list and check off names as your attendees arrive. If you're going for a more personalized check-in process, where you'd like to put a face to each name, then printing off your attendee information list and checking people in the old-fashioned way might be the better solution for you.\n\n\n\nPost-event follow-up\n\n\n\nYour event might be over, but your registration platform is still working hard for you. Review your reports and use your data insights to start planning your next event. The data you collected from your attendees when they registered will be valuable as you look ahead to your next event. And don't forget to send an email blast using your registration platform's email tool to thank your attendees for coming, give them follow-up information, or promote your next big event.The best part of using a registration platform? The tools we mentioned above are just the tip of the iceberg.

Attendees may see your ticket price as a deciding factor on whether or not to attend your event. Plus, setting the right price for your expected number of guests will help cover the costs of hosting your event and allow you to put your profits towards the next one. Ready to get started? Our pricing guide is here with advice to help you research, set your price, and decide what strategy is right for you!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Do your research\n\n\n\nAs you get ready to&nbsp;sell your tickets, be sure to read up on similar events to yours and look back to previous events you've hosted. This will help you gauge how many people you can expect will attend your latest event and what price they'd be willing to pay for your tickets. More specifically, here are two ways to determine your event pricing:\n\n\n\nCompare to competitors\n\n\n\nLook up events in your area on Google and across social media. Once you've found relevant events, take a look at their ticket prices. When doing this though, be aware that various factors (e.g., time of year, location, their talent lineup) could significantly impact the price and offerings of seemingly \u201csimilar\u201d events. Therefore, don't treat these comparisons as hard and fast rules; do what makes sense for your event!\n\n\n\nSurvey your community\n\n\n\nYou don't have to brave this alone! Ask people in your target audience what they'd be willing to pay for your event. If you've done events before, reach out to past attendees or revisit their feedback from previous&nbsp;post-event surveys. If you're the new event in town, ask locals to share their thoughts using some guided questions prepared ahead of time such as:\n\n\n\n\nHow much would you pay for tickets to this kind of event?\n\n\n\nOnce you've got your tickets, how much extra would you be willing to spend onsite (for parking, food, drinks, etc.)?\n\n\n\nAt this given ticket price, what would your expectations of the event be like?\n\n\n\nHow far out of your way would you go to attend an event like this?\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate your ticket pricing\n\n\n\nPricing your tickets is one of the hardest decisions of an event organizer, especially for first-timers. But rest assured: there is no single right answer for the \u201cbest\u201d price. Instead, think of your ticket pricing as numbers you will continually assess, test, and adapt to what your audience wants.\n\n\n\nFirst, use the projected expenses from the budget you've created while&nbsp;planning your event&nbsp;to determine how much revenue you'll need to break even. Take this number plus the extra you hope to make in profit, and divide that total by your expected number of attendees to gauge the average price per ticket you'd like to make. However, while this is a good rule of thumb, understand these numbers are bound to change over time, particularly as you account for additional ticket types.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStep 3: Pick your ticket types\n\n\n\nOne size may not fit all when it comes to&nbsp;pricing tickets. Having various price levels can ensure there's an option for everyone, so more people can come out to your event. Plus, offering multiple types could make the less expensive tickets seem more affordable, while the more expensive tickets look more VIP. Amidst the many options available, here's a few key ticket types that many organizers use:\n\n\n\nGeneral admission\n\n\n\nThese are your most important tickets! They're on sale for the longest amount of time and are the baseline for pricing your discount and premium tickets.\n\n\n\nVIP\n\n\n\nFrom front-row seats to meet &amp; greets with your lineup, these premium-priced tickets are the perfect upgrade for your current audience and for newcomers wanting a first-class experience they won't forget.\n\n\n\nMulti-day or one-day passes\n\n\n\nIf your event spans multiple days, offering this ticket type allows attendees the flexibility to choose which days they sign up for based on their availability.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Determine your ticket pricing strategy\n\n\n\nNow that you've got your ticket offerings solidified, as part of your&nbsp;event marketing strategy, you'll need to figure out how you'll incentivize people to buy their tickets ahead of time. This is because, in reality, 50% of tickets don't usually sell until the week of the actual event. Enter: the discount. When used effectively, this powerful tool can solve this issue and motivate attendees to secure their tickets ASAP!\n\n\n\nThe key to an effective discount strategy is being selective. There are a lot of discount options out there, so focus on offering one or a small combination of them to kick your ticket sales into high gear. To help you get the ball rolling, here are some event discount ideas to amp up your event promotion!\n\n\n\n1. Early-bird tickets\n\n\n\nReward your most proactive ticket buyers for buying their tickets before your entire event lineup is announced. Plus, selling lots of early-bird tickets will help give you peace of mind as you pay for deposits and finalize your event budget.\n\n\n\n2. Referral discounts\n\n\n\nWord of mouth is one of the most powerful marketing strategies, so take advantage of it by rewarding people for inviting friends and family to your event! You can also reach out to influencers and provide them with a personalized discount code to share with their followers.\n\n\n\n3. Group deals\n\n\n\nOffer a discounted rate to customers who buy their tickets in bulk for a large group. Because the amount of marketing you need to sell the rest of those tickets is reduced, you're saving money and able to pass those savings onto your ticket buyers.\n\n\n\n4. First-time discounts\n\n\n\nGive your first-time customers the opportunity to save a little extra on one of your ticket types. This will encourage newcomers to check things out and build trust with your organization, while staying on track towards your revenue goals with the rest of your ticket types.\n\n\n\n5. Exclusive ticket upgrades\n\n\n\nSell your more premium tickets at a discount for a limited time to incentivize customers to splurge a little. This is especially effective for people who are on the fence about whether to upgrade their tickets or not.\n\n\n\n6. Bundles\n\n\n\nIf you have an event series, you can bundle upcoming events with your current one (e.g., offer a discount for buying tickets to your next three events) to encourage and reward loyalty. You can also sell bundles of perks like parking passes, meal vouchers, or merchandise with your ticket.\n\n\n\n7. Plan-ahead pricing\n\n\n\nBy telling customers your tickets will be cheaper now than on the day of your event, they'll want to grab tickets fast before that price bump kicks in. Plus, selling tickets at the door for a higher price can help increase your event's perceived value (e.g., $49 online in advance versus $99 at the door).\n\n\n\nWith so many options out there, no two ticket pricing strategies are the same. What's successful for one event type could look totally different for another. Therefore, be selective with your event pricing and the discounts you choose, tailoring to what best suits your event. And remember to always be improving. With an&nbsp;intuitive ticketing platform&nbsp;like TicketLeap, you can pull reports to help assess which tickets you're selling the most of and which discounts are being used. That way, you can be confident you're maximizing your ticket sales and on track to making your next event a smash hit!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6481f89aa14c4ca683709f1c_person-stacking-money-coins-scaled-1-1024x614.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

Whether you're the event organizer of a farm, orchard, school, or another organization, hosting fall events is a surefire way to draw in excited attendees and drive more revenue at the height of the season. Looking for ways to level up your event with some extra fall-related fun? We've got some fall activity ideas for you to try!\n\n\n\n1. Pumpkin carving\n\n\n\nHelp your attendees get into the spirit of fall (and Halloween!) with a pumpkin carving station. Besides pumpkins of course, you'll need spoons for gutting your pumpkins, stencils and markers for attendees to plan what they'll carve, and carving utensils to bring that vision to life. If you need to save some time, consider having the pumpkins pre-gutted so attendees can get straight to carving. You could also put out some acrylic paints so they can paint their pumpkin and give it an even more personal touch! Once they're done, display the pumpkins somewhere at your venue and even host a friendly competition with prizes for the best pumpkin masterpieces. Then, at the end of the day, let your attendees take theirs home, giving them a one-of-a-kind souvenir from your event!\n\n\n\n2. Bonfire\n\n\n\nAs the sun sets and the air gets a bit chilly, bonfires are a fan favorite addition for outdoor venues. It's a unique way to foster community, bringing attendees together to share spooky stories, enjoy some s'mores, and maybe even have a jam session with some of your event's performers! As one of your fall festival ideas, this could be the ideal setting for an afterparty to wind down from the main festivities earlier that day. You could build one large fire or a few smaller ones (depending on the size of your event), set up chairs, and sell s'mores supplies. Don't forget to check that your venue permits bonfires, and make sure to have a\u00a0staff member\u00a0watching it at all times. You'll also want to consult with your state and city's open burn regulations, as well as any local ordinances.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. Cider tasting\n\n\n\nNothing screams fall like a hot cup of apple cider! Set up a cider station for people to enjoy, along with some extra options to spice up their drink (like orange zest, cinnamon sticks, or apple slices). Your cider tasting can also be the perfect time to celebrate Oktoberfest, with beer and hard cider tastings (definitely among popular fall festival activities for adults)! You could get\u00a0your sponsors\u00a0and local vendors involved too, letting them share samples of their drinks with your attendees and help them get their products out there.\n\n\n\n4. Candy corner\n\n\n\nTrick-or-treating isn't the only time for filling up on candy! As a sure hit among kids or adults with a sweet tooth, having a booth for building your own bag of festive candy can be a tasty addition to your event. You could include candy corn, gummies, butterscotch, chocolate covered pretzels, and other candies in an assortment of reds, yellows, and oranges to match the fall atmosphere. Set the candy out in decorative containers with tongs or serving spoons, with clear bags for people to fill to the brim. You could also try a candy apple bar where attendees dip their own apples (either slices or whole apples) into caramel before covering it with toppings like peanuts, sprinkles, or chocolate chips. You'll want to be mindful of any potential nut allergies, so consider sending\u00a0registration questions\u00a0about them to your attendees to accommodate accordingly.\u200d\n\n\n\n5. Flower bouquet station\n\n\n\nLet your event-goers build a beautiful bouquet at a flower bar, complete with seasonal flowers like sunflowers, chrysanthemums, and warm-colored roses. Set the flowers out in pales or wooden crates, with labels on them in case anyone's curious what kind of flowers they are. Add other fall items for the bouquets at your station, like colorful autumn leaves or pine cones. These flowers could be wrapped in paper or burlap, set in mason jars, or even be placed inside a small carved out pumpkin. It'll be a perfect decoration to take home that your attendees are sure to tell their friends about!\u200d\n\n\n\n6. Fall-themed photo ops\n\n\n\nChannel your\u00a0inner photographer, and build a cute photo booth at your venue that's decked out in tons of fall-related decorations. It'll be a perfect spot for attendees to capture some memorable moments at your event. Pick your location (e.g., in front of some barn doors or a wagon) and decorate it with things like pumpkins, string lights, hay bales, or warm-colored balloons. You could even reuse some old rustic doors as a\u00a0sustainable option. Consider stringing a banner across the backdrop with a witty phrase about fall and\/or your brand name. Remember, this is a prime opportunity for your\u00a0event marketing! So, encourage people to tag your Instagram, Facebook, or other social media accounts when they post their photos with your backdrop.\n\n\n\n7. Barn dancing\n\n\n\nTime to pull out those cowboy boots! For this fall activity, all you need is a big open floor, whether under a pavilion, outside on a flat surface, or in an actual barn. Hire a caller who'll teach your attendees different square dances, line dances, and other fun moves to do. You can have a live band or DJ playing the music they'll dance along to. This'll build community and create fond memories for all your attendees, giving them a chance to chat (and dance!) with fellow event-goers they may not have met otherwise.\u200d\n\n\n\n8. Carnival games\n\n\n\nLooking for some fall event ideas that are fun for the whole family? Try throwing a carnival at your event! Add fall-themed games like bobbing for apples or pumpkin bowling, or classic carnival games like a ring toss or dunk tank. You could also offer face painting or a craft corner for kids to make some festive fall-related crafts. If you're\u00a0hosting an event on a farm, this is the perfect opportunity to offer pony rides or open up a small petting zoo for people to visit. You could also rent a mechanical bull for the adults to try, and watch as they embark on a wild ride!\n\n\n\n\u200d\n\n\n\nFalling for any of these fall event ideas yet? Give some of them a try and level up your\u00a0next fall event. Then, as you're planning your event, consider using TicketLeap's user-friendly platform to sell your tickets!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64b7e91114c1856836e7dd40_two-girls-carving-pumpkins-scaled-1-1024x733.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":97,"name":"Event Ideas","slug":"event-ideas","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":97,"taxonomy":"category","description":"<span data-sheets-root=\"1\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Let TicketLeap help you brainstorm for your next awesome event!

During haunt season, many event organizers are on the lookout for spooky Halloween decorating ideas that'll also save them some money. Here are a few DIY Halloween decorations that are simple and perfect for your haunted attraction!\n\n\n\n1. Creepy coffin\n\n\n\nFor this spooky Halloween decoration, outline the pieces of your coffin on cardboard, foam board, or wood to cut out (templates are super helpful here!). Then, use tape, nails, or spray-on adhesive to secure the pieces together. Once everything is glued and dried, select a color to spray paint your coffin with. After your paint is done drying, here comes the fun part! Decorate your&nbsp;creepy coffin&nbsp;with chains, skulls, or any other scary item that comes to mind. Take it up a notch by adding LED lights on the inside to make your coffin glow from within!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Ghastly candle centerpieces&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGather up some pool noodles and cut them at varying lengths. The longest piece will determine how tall your&nbsp;ghastly candle centerpiece&nbsp;is. Depending on how large you want your centerpiece to be, group together between 3-5 pieces at a time, and use a hot glue gun on a low setting to glue your pieces together. Then, once they're dry, use your glue gun to add droplets running down the outer room of your pool noodles to recreate the look of candle wax dripping. When that's all squared away, spray-paint your pool noodles in the color of your choosing and even spice it up with some glitter that matches your event's theme. Finally, top off your candles with small LED flameless candles to bring your candle centerpiece to life!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Petrifying pumpkin doorway\n\n\n\nFirst, measure how long and wide you want your&nbsp;pumpkin-covered entryway&nbsp;to be. Using those measurements, piece together PVC pipes and their connectors to build the outline of your doorway. Then, secure the arch you've just built to the actual doorway of your event using zip ties or heavy-duty clear tape. Next, buy some hollow plastic pumpkins in varying colors and cut out two holes in the back on opposite sides of each pumpkin. Use zip ties to loop through those holes and secure your pumpkins around the arch until it's completely covered. Lastly, loop through some LED lights and fill in any sparse areas of the archway with dark-colored garland to complete the final look.\n\n\n\n4. Bone-chilling spider webs&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat's more spine-tingling than being surrounded by&nbsp;spiderwebs? To give your attendees the creepy crawlies, start by placing clear thumbtacks in the wall in the shape of a spider web. These will be the spokes for your web. Use orange, white, or black yarn found in your local craft store and hook around the spokes to weave a spider web. Be sure to add a plastic spider on each web as a finishing touch. If you're looking to really give your attendees the willies, get some stretchy fake cobwebs to cover your venue from top to bottom with!\n\n\n\n5. Perilous potion bottles\n\n\n\nThis decoration idea is a perfect way to reuse some simple household items for your spooky Halloween decorating while also\u00a0practicing sustainability! To start, gather up some glass jars or bottles in different sizes. Fill your \u201cpotion bottles\u201d with water and add food coloring in various colors to each. If you want to make your potions look extra convincing, add some extra elements like sprinkling glitter or bits of colored styrofoam into each bottle. You could also put herbs or other plants in jars that'll look like mysterious ingredients for your potions. Lastly, get creative and label your bottles with clever names like \u201cVicious Venom\u201d or \u201cImmortal Elixir\u201d. Considering how simple they are to make, feel free to create as many of these spooky Halloween decorations as you'd like!\n\n\n\n6. Wicked witch parking&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis one is super simple and hilarious! All you need to do is gather up a few brooms (and a witch hat or two!) and find an area in your venue's parking lot to place them. To add to the fun, label the area \u201cWicked Witch Parking,\u201d \u201cDesignated Witch Parking,\u201d or another creative name. Rather than use a parking space, you could also\u00a0hang some brooms on a wall\u00a0with a sign saying \u201cBroom Parking Only.\u201d It'll be sure to get a laugh out of your attendees after spooking them all night long! Pro tip: Snap some candid photos of attendees' reactions throughout your event to include in your\u00a0haunt marketing materials.\n\n\n\n7. Lifeless flower bouquets\n\n\n\nPurchase a few bouquets of flowers with varieties (like roses, hydrangeas, or lavender) that don't drop their petals easily. Wrap your flowers in bundles of 8-10 using a twist tie or rubber band, then hang them upside down from either a clothes hanger or hook to dry. Next, place them in a dark, dry location away from sunlight. A closet or garage will do the trick! After 2-3 weeks, your&nbsp;dried flowers&nbsp;will be ready to place in your vases. As an idea, you can try spray-painting your flowers black if you want, especially on the stems and leaves. Finally, to make your elegant Halloween decorations fit in more with your event's theme, finish your bouquets off with unconventional items like cobwebs or twigs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Ominous old pictures\n\n\n\nLike in most horror movies, ominous old family pictures hang from the walls that'll give you the chills! Recreate this feeling with your Halloween event decorations by looking up some vintage family pictures online and printing them in black and white. Get a&nbsp;few dusty frames&nbsp;to place them in and cover them with cobwebs or a splatter of red paint to give the illusion of blood. Who knew scary Halloween decorations could be so easy!\n\n\n\n9. Ghoulish ghosts\n\n\n\nFor this haunting decoration, pick up a ton of styrofoam heads and cheesecloth at your local craft store. To turn them into ghosts, simply drape the long, flowing pieces of cloth over each head and hang them from the ceiling. There you have it,\u00a0ghoulish ghosts\u00a0in a matter of seconds! One more thing: as part of\u00a0keeping your haunted attraction safe, remember to hang your ghosts high enough to ensure a clear path for your attendees to walk through.\n\n\n\nNow that we've got your creative juices flowing, let's get a jump start on planning your haunted attraction! Sign up with a ticketing platform like\u00a0TicketLeap, that'll equip you with a full suite of\u00a0haunt ticketing features\u00a0for your next event.

As they venture through your haunted attraction, you'll want procedures in place that'll ensure your event runs smoothly and everyone is safe at all times (so there are no actual scares on our watch!). That way, your attendees can simply get lost in the spine-chilling experience and have the best time possible. Ready to learn more? Let's uncover the secrets of hosting a terrifying haunt that's also a safe and secure one!\n\n\n\n1. Conduct a risk assessment&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo conduct a risk assessment, record&nbsp;any potential hazards&nbsp;like uneven flooring, low ceilings, sharp edges, and poor lighting to help you keep an eye out for (and prevent!) any accidents from happening. As you analyze your event space, consider how likely these hazards are to occur and what prevention steps you might take. Also, consider the number and types of guests attending (including kids and the elderly), how your actors will move around, and the different scare elements involved. By recording this information and using it to make informed safety decisions, you'll be on your way to creating a safe and enjoyable haunted attraction.\n\n\n\n2. Develop a safety plan\n\n\n\nTo kick off your safety plan, start by reviewing the risk assessment you just put together. Outline well-defined emergency procedures for incidents like fires, severe weather, or medical emergencies, as well as implement effective security measures to handle them. Make sure pathways and exits are made clear, and your props and sets are securely in place so attendees don't accidentally trip as they walk through. It's also a smart idea to map out your haunt with clear markers to the nearest exits. You can share a copy of this map with your attendees prior to the event, as well as post it around your haunt. Depending on the types of scares you have in store, you may need to obtain permits or licenses, like a special effects license or a fire safety permit, for your haunt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Implement fire safety measures\n\n\n\nTo create a super safe haunted attraction, implementing fire safety measures is absolutely essential. For one, install fire extinguishers in easily accessible locations throughout your venue and regularly inspect them to ensure they're in top-notch condition (most need to be replaced roughly every two years). If you need additional insight, reach out to your local fire department for recommendations on where to place them. Prior to\u00a0event day, you should also test and replace the batteries in your fire alarm systems as needed. Remember to have a well-prepared emergency plan that includes when and how to evacuate for any potential fire incidents.\n\n\n\n4. Provide full training for staff and actors\n\n\n\nOn top of bringing your scary experience to life, your\u00a0staff members\u00a0are also responsible for knowing how to provide a safe experience for your guests. Leading up to event day, dedicate time to go over your safety plan and emergency protocols with them. For smooth coordination, establish who their primary and secondary points of contact are in case of an emergency and how to quickly reach them (e.g., cell phone, walkie-talkies). For your actors specifically, they should receive specific training on proper scare techniques and guest interaction (like whether or not they are allowed to touch attendees). Plus, make sure your actors have costumes and makeup that don't hinder their vision or mobility, allowing them to deliver their spine-tingling performances flawlessly.\n\n\n\n\u200d5. Communicate safety instructions clearly\n\n\n\nAs potential attendees get ready to buy their tickets, ensure your website and\u00a0event ticketing page\u00a0clearly inform buyers of your scare intensity level and any age restrictions so everyone has a spooktacular time. Once they've secured their tickets to your haunting experience, you should also send them an email with any important safety instructions and emergency protocols they may need to know beforehand. It's also super important to display signs throughout your attraction that remind guests of your safety guidelines as well. You'll want to hear from your guests too! Because their feedback is valuable in keeping your experience safe for all, encourage them to report any concerns they may have to you and your staff.\u00a0\n\n\n\n6. Have attendees sign your waiver\n\n\n\nWith TicketLeap's full suite of\u00a0haunt ticketing features, adding waivers and building comprehensive event pages are a breeze! On your event page, you'll want to include any important information upfront about expectations regarding the spooky nature of your haunt and any rules your attendees need to abide by, like not being allowed to touch actors. You'll want to disclose any effects of your haunted attraction that may not be suitable for those with certain medical conditions. For instance, make sure to specify if you use any strobe lights that could trigger a seizure. With TicketLeap, you can seamlessly embed your waiver into the checkout process for your ticket buyers to sign when purchasing their tickets, so you know everyone's on the same page!\n\n\n\n7. Hire professional security\n\n\n\nTo help maintain order and swiftly address any potential threats that come up, you should hire trained security professionals as part of your event's team. Your security personnel can monitor lines to preemptively identify any disturbances and\u00a0look out for ticket scalpers. For an extra layer of security and your attendees' peace of mind, consider implementing bag checks and metal detectors at your haunt's entrance too. With professional security personnel on board, you can rest assured that your guests' safety is in capable hands and can focus on delivering your most thrilling experience to date!\n\n\n\n8. Manage crowd flow\n\n\n\nIn order to control the number of attendees enjoying the thrills of your haunt at any given time, implement timed entry ticketing (part of TicketLeap's\u00a0complete set of features!) so your attendees can select the best time to come to your event. This will help you stay within the capacity limit of your venue, ensuring a safe, comfortable experience for everyone. Depending on the size of your haunt, set up multiple check-in areas using stanchions, floor tape, or spray paint (if you're outside) to differentiate your lines, help direct your crowd, and prevent any overcrowding. By following these crowd management strategies, you'll be well on your way to creating a haunting event that flows seamlessly from start to finish.\n\n\n\nReady to take your haunted attraction to the next level?

Try sending a few personalized invites to people you want at your event. Show them how they would benefit from attending. To make it easy for them to share, type up a few posts that include the event page URL and event hashtag that they can easily copy and paste and post to their networks.\n\n\n\nGet press\n\n\n\nFirst, figure out who you want to write or talk about your event tickets to. What does your target audience read, or do they listen to radio more? Do they like newspapers, blogs, radio stations? Maybe it's worth seeing if you can be added to a list of weekly or monthly events happening in your city or town. Once you narrow down the specific media outlets you want to cover your event, find out the individuals covering topics similar to yours -- these are the people you're going to actually contact.\n\n\n\nThen, write your own story around the event using the 5 W's: who, what, when, where, and why. Or, at least create a fact sheet for your event using the same criteria. This will give the author a clear guideline of what they should write about - making their jobs easier, and more likely they will actually write about your upcoming event.\n\n\n\nWhen sending your pitch,&nbsp;take the time to make it personalized, like you actually read and enjoy the other pieces they have written. If you do not get a response, wait a few days to a week to email them again asking if they received your original email. Getting press can take some time, so you want to start early, even a few months before your event.\n\n\n\nPaid advertisements\n\n\n\nIf you have a little bit of money to spend, try some Facebook ads. You can target the people you want to attend your event and spend just a few dollars a day. If you have a mailing list of people who've attended previous events, Facebook has a cool tool called&nbsp;Lookalike Audiences. Upload the mailing list, and Facebook will display your ad to people with similar likes and interests.\n\n\n\nOffline\n\n\n\nEveryone talks about what you can do online, but don't forget about offline opportunities. Try printing and hanging eye-catching and informative flyers in places that will reach your target market. In addition to a brief description of your event, be sure to include the location, date and time,\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0(advance and door price), URL to purchase event tickets online, and any age or other restrictions.\n\n\n\nIn real life\n\n\n\nThis one may sound obvious, but talk about your event to the people you know! Don't assume the people you meet in person have read about your event online. Another option is to talk to people at other, similar events. We don't recommend treating other events as an opportunity to advertise your event, but we definitely can encourage you to invite people in one-on-one conversations.\n\n\n\nYour event page\n\n\n\nConvincing people to visit your event page is only half the battle. You'll also want them to purchase tickets, right? Creating an easy-to-navigate, beautiful event page helps showcase your event and get people excited about it! Even if you're not a computer whiz or a professional photographer, you can still create something for ticket sales that is more than just a transaction.\n\n\n\nSometimes images are better than words\n\n\n\nUse\u00a0hi-res photos\u00a0that give people an idea of what to expect at your event. We've found it looks best if the image does not contain any text, these images aren't a flier, they should be of people! People having fun, people learning, inside or outside -- whatever matches your event. By scanning one image for a second, people will know more about your event than reading paragraphs of text.\n\n\n\nHave a descriptive About Tab\n\n\n\nSince your images don't have any text, you're going to want to fill in that About Tab for your online ticket sales! This tab is where you describe your event and describe what people will get out of coming to your event. Make sure you clearly write all the practical details your event goers may need to know about the event like age and ticket restrictions, complicated building entry, if there's parking and whether there's food.\n\n\n\nConvey value in the ticket price\n\n\n\nIt can be tough figuring out how much to charge for a ticket, or to even charge at all. Everyone's event goal is different as far as making money or just breaking even, but one thing to keep in mind is the event goer has to see the value in purchasing your ticket. Too inexpensive ticket prices and people may not think the event isn't worth their time. Too expensive and people may think it's not worth their money. There is a sweet spot, though!\u200d\n\n\n\nGet out there and sell those tickets!\n\n\n\nAfter your event page is live, don't assume everyone knows about it. Keep on talking and advertising right up until your event starts (unless it sells out in advance, then good on you!) Remember that hashtag you created? Make sure you use it while posting during your event and make it known to event goers so they use it, too. This will create buzz during and after your event to encourage attendees to get excited for your next one!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/5a70db78a290250001f06d29_tixDollas1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

By learning how to promote an event on Facebook, you\u2019ll connect your events with tons of new, interested attendees in no time. Excited to learn more? We\u2019re here to show you the ropes of event promotion on Facebook to help you grow your events.\n\n\n\nHow to create an event on Facebook\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you\u2019ll need to build your Facebook event! To give you the most time to market your event, you should create a Facebook events page as soon as your event\u2019s main details are solidified (even if your event is more than a year out!). To help you with this, here are some best practices for building a strong event page.\n\n\n\n\nTitle:&nbsp;Clearly and uniquely state what your event is about in 64 characters or less (ideally under 40 characters for your Facebook ads later).\n\n\n\n\n\nCover photo:&nbsp;Display an eye-catching image that'll get viewers to stop scrolling, especially since it'll be their first impression of your Facebook event. This means use bright colors, add high-quality&nbsp;event photography, and get creative with your graphics!\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:&nbsp;Once you've got the essentials covered like the date, time, and location, you'll want to highlight what your event has to offer, from special guests to fun activities to expected attendance numbers based on previous years. Consider linking off to your event's website too for more info.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd tickets:&nbsp;Include a link to your event's&nbsp;ticketing page&nbsp;to sell your tickets!&nbsp;TicketLeap&nbsp;makes this super easy, helping you set up an irresistible ticketing page in just minutes (we may be a little biased!).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion tab:&nbsp;Use this feed to update your viewers with new information about your guest lineup, exclusive discounts, parking details, etc. Encourage fans to ask their burning questions here, so you can easily respond to them!\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-hosts:&nbsp;Add any partners or featured sponsors as co-hosts to boost your event's credibility and so they can also invite tons of people to your event too!\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory:&nbsp;Under the \u201cMarket Your Event\u201d tab, include a relevant tag pertaining to the topic of your event (e.g., Sports, Foods, Comedy) and your location to help improve your&nbsp;event marketing SEO&nbsp;on Facebook, so when people search for events in your area, they'll find yours first!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:&nbsp;Facebook Event Page\n\n\n\nFree ways to start promoting your event\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve created your event, invite as many people as possible to get the ball rolling! You can invite up to 500 people yourself, and others can also invite 500 people. Be careful to send closer to 100-150 invites out at a given time though (and no more than 200 to be safe) to avoid Facebook accidentally marking your event as spam. You can also personally invite people through Facebook Messenger who follow your page and encourage them to invite friends!\n\n\n\nEncourage your co-hosts and sponsors to share your event with their audiences too, as well as tag them in relevant posts to open up your network and gain more impressions. You can also share your event in relevant Facebook groups so people with related interests can learn more about what you have to offer.\n\n\n\nCreate and share exciting content on your Facebook page to help build a buzz around your upcoming events. Leading up to event day, share highlights of your guest lineup, behind-the-scenes footage, exclusive discounts, and more to hype up your attendees. You can use your Instagram event content on Facebook as well to get more out of each post! Short-form videos (aka Reels) are especially powerful for expanding your event\u2019s reach to new audiences. And don\u2019t be afraid to repurpose content for your TikTok too!\n\n\n\nLooking for even more ways to promote events on your Facebook for free? Unlike Instagram, Facebook lets you share links on each of your posts \u2013 so take full advantage of it! Make sure your event\u2019s website and ticketing page are easily accessible in your bio and your posts. Plus, share the link to your Facebook event in your newsletter, on your website, across your other social media platforms, and on other channels in your event marketing strategy to cover all your bases!\n\n\n\nHow to boost an event on Facebook\n\n\n\nLook at you! You\u2019ve built a stellar Facebook event and started promoting it everywhere you can. Now, it\u2019s time to take your Facebook event marketing to the next level with paid ads. Let\u2019s walk through how to use the Facebook Boost Event feature to get your events in front of even more people!\n\n\n\n1. Build your Facebook event's ad\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve opted into boosting your event, the components of your Facebook event ad are similar, yet simplified, compared to those of your event page. Each ad includes three main components: an image, a description, and a call-to-action button. These follow similar best practices to creating a Facebook event page; however, you\u2019ll want to keep your description brief (Facebook recommends 3 lines at most). Ensure it covers only your most important information (e.g., age requirements, location) and encourages them to buy their tickets!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Facebook Event Ad\n\n\n\n2. Determine your target audience\n\n\n\nThis step wields the power to maximize your advertising budget and get your events in front of prospective attendees who may not have otherwise known about it. To do this, you can decide between these three types of audiences:\n\n\n\nA. New Audiences\n\n\n\nSelect specific characteristics to target such as location, demographics, or general interests. For an event, localized ads are the best place to start, so use broad interest-based targeting in the area surrounding your event (like music lovers in Owensboro, Kentucky for our concert example).\n\n\n\nB. Custom Audiences\n\n\n\nTarget people already interested in your event, from visiting your website, using your app, joining your email list, or engaging with your Facebook profile. This is great for remarketing purposes and for reminding loyal customers to share your upcoming event with their friends!\n\n\n\nC. Lookalike Audiences\n\n\n\nBuild new audiences for your ads modeled after your Custom Audiences. As a powerful example, you can put in an email list of last year\u2019s attendees, and Meta will create a lookalike audience of people with similar characteristics and interests.\n\n\n\nPro tip: start with as big of an audience as you can, then narrow it down based on who\u2019s converting the most (and turn off ads to the ones that don\u2019t).\n\n\n\n3. Allocate your ad spend\n\n\n\nHow much you plan to spend varies significantly depending on a ton of factors like your event category type, budget, venue size, ticket pricing, and what your desired outcome is. To allocate your budget, you can either set a campaign-wide spending limit with daily budgets for each of your given ads or just set a daily budget that runs continuously until you stop it. Since you generally have more control over your ad spend with a campaign-wide limit, we recommend using that to set a monthly budget, allocate that to the ads you\u2019ve created, then adjust from there.\n\n\n\n4. Set your campaign's duration\n\n\n\nSince successful Facebook ads are all about optimizing, you should set your campaign\u2019s duration as far in advance as possible. The more time you let your ads run, the more optimized your ads will become and the more efficient your ad spend will be. Launching your Facebook ads even a year or more out from your event day is ideal, though even a few months out could make a notable difference for your attendance numbers. Given enough time, you\u2019re sure to find your ads\u2019 sweet spot!\n\n\n\n5. Launch your Facebook event ads!\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set up all the elements of your Facebook ad and connected your desired payment method, review how your ad will look across mobile and desktop (and on Instagram if you opt into boosting your event there too). Once everything looks good, select \u201cBoost event now\u201d and you\u2019re ready to lift off!\n\n\n\n6. Monitor and optimize your ad campaign regularly\n\n\n\nCreating and launching your event ads is only half the battle; the rest is optimizing them. Once your Facebook ads are live, use the Breakdown feature at the top of your Meta Ads Manager dashboard to keep an eye on how they\u2019re performing and ensure your money is spent correctly. Check that your ads are reaching people in the right location (you don\u2019t want ads for an event in Florida to target people in Wisconsin!) and are actually converting to clicks (i.e., ticket sales!). From there, you can decide to boost your spending on the ads that are performing well, and pause the ones that aren\u2019t.\n\n\n\nCongrats! You\u2019ve successfully learned how to promote an event on Facebook! From posting fun event-related content and launching powerful ad campaigns, you\u2019ll be on track to gaining tons of new fans and selling more tickets with help from Facebook.

A well-written press release is more likely to be shared by journalists and other publications. That means you'll drive even more interest in your event and build brand awareness! Read on to learn how to write an effective press release and boost your promotional efforts today.\n\n\n\nWhat is a press release?\n\n\n\nA press release is considered your official event announcement and includes all the relevant, exciting details of your upcoming experience. This includes the five W's: when and where your event will take place, what it's all about, who will be there, and why you created it. Not only can a well-written press release be a super valuable tool to add to your\u00a0event marketing strategy, media personnel (usually your local newspapers and journalists) will be more likely to find your press release and may be inclined to share it!\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of an event press release?\n\n\n\nAn event press release is a proven, low-cost way to promote your upcoming experience, but the benefits don't stop there! Let's dive into a few reasons that you and your team should consider creating a press release for your event, shall we?\u200d\n\n\n\nIncrease brand awareness\n\n\n\nThis tool can be a formal way to build trust, better your organization's reputation, and create brand awareness with wider audiences. When a press release is shared, you'll gain immediate exposure to new readers (and potential customers). This has the added benefit of building trust between your local audience and your organization, as a credible news source publicly supporting you can really boost your reputation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrive event attendance\n\n\n\nThink about the number of people who are keeping up with trending news online. That's right, a ton! Writing a press release for your event gives you a chance to target attendees you may not be able to reach through typical marketing efforts like social media posts and email blasts. Creating a well-written press release will help generate even more buzz, ultimately\u00a0increasing ticket sales\u00a0and getting more excited customers into your event.\n\n\n\nSupport SEO efforts\n\n\n\nEvent press releases can also help your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. It gives you an opportunity to include targeted keywords relating to your event, making it more likely that potential customers will find it when they type in those words on search engines like Google and Bing. Plus, when other websites repost your press release and link back to yours, it shows Google and Bing that your content is valuable and should be ranked higher on their Search Engine Results Page.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow to write an effective event press release\n\n\n\nWriting a press release may seem daunting at first, but we'll help you through it! When drafting your announcement, include these seven key sections as a template:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate and location\n\n\n\nInclude the publication date of your press release and the location of your event (e.g., January 29, 2025 - Pittsburgh, PA) first. If you want your press release to be shared as soon as possible, then replace the date with \u201cfor immediate release.\u201d This is important because you don't want journalists to share the details of your event before you're ready! The actual date of your event will be shared later in the body of the press release.\n\n\n\nHeadline&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe key to a successful press release is a top-notch title or headline. You want to write something catchy that stops readers in their tracks and includes the name of your event. For example, if you're hosting a comedy fundraiser, your title could be \u201cThe Laugh of the Century at Sarah's Comedy Club Fundraiser.\u201d You can even further optimize for SEO by adding your most important keyword in the headline.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSubheading&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA subheading is an optional addition that expands on your headline. It should be one sentence and provide a quick overview of the main point of your press release and make readers want to learn more. For instance, a description like&nbsp;\u201cHelp us raise money to renovate Sarah's comedy club while listening to the best comedians in town,\u201d will get people invested.\n\n\n\nLead\n\n\n\nWrite a summary that gives the reader a brief overview of your event's story. Essentially, your lead is an introduction paragraph that answers the who, what, when, and why. Leave further details and explanations for the press release body.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPro tip: We recommend writing your lead after you've completed the rest of the press release sections!\u200d\n\n\n\nBody&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou'll be spending most of your time writing the body of your press release, as you'll now dive into what's in store for attendees. Are there any celebrities, popular vendors, guest speakers, or raffles? Spill the details! Provide the most newsworthy information up front and end with the more granular information. Be sure to really communicate the value people will receive from attending your event.\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n\n\nInclude any testimonials about your event throughout the body copy of your press release. Whether straight from the event organizer or special guests, this is the time to talk yourself up! Plus, including what past event-goers have said about their experience at your event helps give credibility to what you're promising to deliver.\n\n\n\nCompany information\n\n\n\nTo end your press release, include the details of your company and what you do. If you already have a prepared elevator pitch, this is the place to add it. You should also include media contact information (contact name, phone number, and email address) for anyone who wants to follow up with you. You can include the details of any special guests or keynote speakers you discussed in the press release as well. They'll love the additional publicity!\n\n\n\nUsing these guidelines to write your event press release will make it easier than ever, and you'll be sure to\u00a0drive more ticket sales\u00a0to your event!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6390c27fdb663d2f0130b614_PressReleaseBlogImageJazzMusicians-scaled-1-1024x702.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Well, there's no need to worry. There are plenty of ways to boost event registrations without spending any money, and with an easy-to-use event registration software, you won't have to spend much time, either.\n\n\n\n1. Alert your existing audience and reward their loyalty\n\n\n\nThe people most likely to register for your next event are people who are already fans of your organization. Your email list will really come in handy here \u2013 send an email and let them know about your upcoming event. If you've held an event before, this is your chance to get some repeat customers by remarketing your events to past attendees. Send out an email campaign and include a loyalty code to encourage them to buy tickets using a discount code or use a \"Buy One, Get One Free\" offer\n\n\n\nIf you don't already have a huge email list, get the message out to your audience on social media. As your audience grows, it's a good idea to keep track of how many people have opened your email marketing blast. A dedicated email tool can give you stats on how many people looked at your event email, how many clicked a link to go through to your event registration page, and how many people haven't even had a chance to open it yet.\n\n\n\n2. Make event registration a breeze\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of things that make potential buyers hesitate to register for an event, so you want to eliminate as many obstacles as possible from the purchasing and registration process (This is where event registration software comes in). Put yourself in the shoes of your event attendees \u2013 you want to do as little typing and clicking as possible to get registered. If there is too much navigating between event pages or your event registration form is too long, potential ticket buyers might leave the transaction.\n\n\n\nA good event registration platform is the tool you need for a frictionless experience for event attendees, from a custom event registration page that looks great and draws in potential attendees, to a streamlined checkout process that is simple to do on any device. And, since event registration software includes a secure way to accept credit card payments, your attendees can feel safe sharing their payment information.\n\n\n\n3. Promote an A-list guest\n\n\n\nDoes your conference have a standout speaker? Is a superstar chef of a local 4-star restaurant doing a cooking demo at your community center? Let people know! A well-known name can generate major buzz, so post some teasers on social media, send an event email before registration begins, and make the big announcement when your event goes live. Your headline speakers will have their own established audiences you can tap into for ticket buyers. Don't forget to tag your special guest so they can easily share your promotional posts with their followers!\n\n\n\n4. Get creative with your event registration options\n\n\n\nEvent registration software allows you to create different ticket types for prospective attendees to register for your event. Creating a tiered ticket pricing system with your event software gives people different options for buying, but you don't want to create too many options and overwhelm them.\n\n\n\nStarting your ticket campaign with early bird discount tickets is great for driving registrations soon after your event goes live. With VIP tickets, you can add value and give your attendees perks when they register, like special seating, early admission, or meet and greet access. Bundled tickets are an opportunity to upsell \u2013 include registration plus merchandise or a meal at your event in a single ticket price. Or create a custom option that suits your unique needs. When it comes to ticket types, the only limit is your imagination.\n\n\n\n5. Create a contest or giveaway on social media\n\n\n\nSocial media giveaways are a virtually free way to get the word out about your event and increase registration. The best platform for your contest is usually the one where you already have the biggest following, but can also help grow your audience. Contests on your social media channels almost always get great engagement, and that can have a positive effect on how much your posts show up in the organic algorithms, meaning you'll get more eyes on your content without spending a dime.\n\n\n\nAn Instagram comment contest where users have to tag their friends boosts engagement for your organization and promotes your event to a totally new audience (don't forget to post a link to your event landing page in your bio). You can also direct your users from one platform to another (Post a link to your Instagram contest) or hold a different giveaway for each platform (have your followers post using your event's custom hashtag or share your event link on Facebook). For only the price of admission, social media giveaways can have big returns when it comes to increasing registrations.\n\n\n\n6. Find an event sponsor or partnership\n\n\n\nFind sponsors for your event by reaching out to businesses or industry organizations related to your event. A thoughtful partnership with a sponsor that matches the values and interests of your organization and audience can do a lot to increase event registrations. Look for businesses that would be interested in connecting with the target audience that you're bringing to your event to make sure they receive as much benefit from the partnership and successful event as you would.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you're running an event about home improvement, pitch a sponsorship to a local hardware store or paint store. Cross-promotion builds awareness when your sponsor promotes your event to their audience, typically in exchange for brand visibility at your event. Cash sponsorships and donations of products or services increase the value of your event, which means that you can charge more for registration and your attendees will still feel like they are getting a lot for their money.\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/61f857b986c05c2960297a82_pexels-josh-sorenson-976866-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":51,"name":"Event Registration","slug":"event-registration","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":51,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Our ticketing platform makes it easy for attendees to register for your next event.

Similar to your other marketing efforts, you'll need to figure out your target audience (your event's niche on Instagram) and create social media content that both resonates with them and helps you reach your goals \u2013 like selling more tickets!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow should I build my event promotion strategy for Instagram?\n\n\n\nBefore we get to creating posts, it's important to have a strategy behind your Instagram event promotion. For one, you'll want to set goals for yourself, including how much you want to grow your account and how many tickets you'll want to sell from your efforts. Then, you'll need to determine what resources you have available. Will you be managing your event's Instagram account yourself, or will you have additional staff members helping you? In addition to creating content, is there any room in your event budget for advertising? For editing your video content, will you edit them within Instagram itself or use a third-party app like CapCut, iMovie, or even Adobe Premiere Pro?\n\n\n\nThe key to growing your Instagram account is consistency. To help with this, try dedicating time in your week to film, edit, and schedule your event Instagram posts. You could also create a content calendar to map out what kinds of posts you'll do and when. This is particularly important in building a buzz around your event's lineup announcements, exclusive ticket discounts, giveaways, and other exciting developments leading up to the big day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat types of Instagram content should I make?\n\n\n\nAs an event promoter, you have a wide range of content types to choose from, each connecting with your event's audience in different ways. That's the beauty of Instagram! By understanding what works best for each type of Instagram event post, you're sure to grow your following and sell more tickets! To help with that, here's a full breakdown of the four main types:\n\n\n\n1. Reels\n\n\n\nExposure level: The majority of viewers are non-followers, and this appears in your followers' feeds as well.\n\n\n\nAbout: Reels are short-form videos (between 15-90 seconds in length) that appear in the dedicated Reels tab, main Instagram feed, and Explore tab. Since the dawn of TikTok, these shorter videos continue to trend and are the key to gaining lots of exposure in front of new audiences. In fact, 85% of viewers prefer videos under 15 seconds, and these short-form videos get between 2-3 times higher engagement than long-form videos. According to Instagram, Reels make up over 50% of the content reshared and is the platform's fastest growing content type, making them the most likely to go viral of your event Instagram posts.\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nGrab viewers' attention in the first three seconds (i.e., \u201cthe hook\u201d).\n\n\n\nUse trending audio clips that encourage viewers to click the audio tab and make a Reel of their own.\n\n\n\nIncorporate quick transitions, effects, and text throughout your video (especially at key scenes) so people watch your whole video.\n\n\n\nCheck out the Inspiration tab in your account's Professional Dashboard for content ideas related to your page and that are most popular with your followers.\n\n\n\nInclude 3-5 hashtags on your post, using a mix of general terms and specific hashtags to your event niche.\n\n\n\nAdd your location to help people in your area discover your Reels more easily.\n\n\n\nInclude a question or call-to-action (like \u201cTag friends in the comments!\u201d) in your post's caption to help drive engagement.\n\n\n\n\n(Bonus!) A few ideas for you:\n\n\n\n\nAsk funny questions to your event attendees.\n\n\n\nFind a trend or challenge and take your own twist on it.\n\n\n\nDo a fun dance or challenge with your event staff.\n\n\n\nFilm a highlight reel from your event day.\n\n\n\nCapture behind-the-scenes clips of your event.\n\n\n\nDo a time-lapse or before &amp; after of your event setup.\n\n\n\nShare tips &amp; tricks in your event's niche (e.g., if you own a farm, show people seasonal recipes or gardening tips).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Posts\n\n\n\nExposure level: The majority of viewers are your followers, although non-followers may discover this in the Explore tab.\n\n\n\nAbout: Social media posts are a collection of between 1-20 photos and videos you can share at a given time in Instagram's feed and on the Explore page. Unlike Reels, you can post longer videos (up to 60 minutes). While Reels are focused on giving you maximum exposure, posts are where you can engage more with your followers. They're the perfect place to show off those event photography skills to Instagram users! Shine the spotlight on your events by posting content like crowd shots from previous events, and announcements of your lineup to get attendees excited!\n\n\n\nBest practices:\u200d\n\n\n\n\nKeep the colors and filters of your posts consistent with your event's branding, and take advantage of natural lighting whenever possible for high-quality photos.\n\n\n\nIf you're posting multiple pieces of content, make sure your most eye-catching one is first and, according to Instagram, it's best if you post a mixture of photos and videos.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdd your location and\/or a calendar reminder of your next event date to relevant posts.\n\n\n\nTag relevant sponsors, featured guests, partners, or other people featured in your event Instagram posts.\n\n\n\nAdd 3-5 hashtags related to your post's topic and event niche.\n\n\n\nWrite a short, compelling caption that encourages your followers to answer a question or take action (like \u201cBuy your tickets,\u201d \u201cShop now,\u201d or \u201cTag a friend\u201d).\n\n\n\nTurn on \u201cUpload at highest quality\u201d in your Instagram account settings for the best quality photos on your posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Stories\n\n\n\nExposure level: Most viewers are your followers, while occasionally non-followers may click into your account's story after discovering one of your Reels or posts.\n\n\n\nAbout: Instagram Stories are photos or short video clips that are only displayed for 24 hours, appearing at the top of your feed or whenever someone clicks your account's profile icon. For all the post types, stories are the most up close and personal way for your followers to get to know you and your events. As just a few ideas, you could create stories that are snapshots of your day as an event organizer, reshare others' posts of your event, or launch a fun poll to engage users.\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nPost at least one story a day. It's a super quick way to stay top of mind with your followers, plus these can be anything!\n\n\n\nHighlight at least 3-5 collections of Instagram Stories to showcase on your profile.\n\n\n\nInclude interactive elements like polls, emoji sliders, and Q&amp;As that encourage your followers to engage with your story.\n\n\n\nAdd links that encourage your viewers to visit your website or event listing to buy their tickets. (Besides the link in your bio, stories is the only place you can share clickable links, so take full advantage of it!)\n\n\n\nMention other accounts in your Instagram Stories (like @ticketleap!). They'll likely share your shoutout on their story with their followers too!\n\n\n\nShare others' posts that are relevant to your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Instagram Live\n\n\n\nExposure level: Primarily just your followers (not easily discoverable to non-followers)\n\n\n\nAbout: Instagram Live is their live-streaming platform that appears at the top of your feed in front of Instagram Stories. This feature can help your event stand out to your followers and strengthen your connections with them. You can also repurpose your Live content by posting it later. Live is particularly great for Q&amp;A sessions with your featured guests and event staff or quick snippets of your event in action (for a little FOMO!).\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nAnnounce beforehand when you'll be going live (on your story or in a post) to hype your followers up before it happens!\n\n\n\nCreate a consistent live-streaming schedule, so your audience can expect when you\u2019ll be live and keep coming back for more each week.\n\n\n\nTake advantage of Practice mode to check your internet connection and do a test run before you actually go live.\n\n\n\nAdd an eye-catching title to your Instagram Live.\n\n\n\nGreet people by name as they enter your live-stream to make it more personal to them and encourage them to stick around.\n\n\n\nFor fun collaborations with others, use Live Rooms to invite up to three other accounts (like a keynote speaker or performer at your events) to join your Live.\n\n\n\nEncourage people to leave questions in the chat for you to answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Channels\n\n\n\nExposure level: Your followers only\n\n\n\nAbout: Broadcast channels are a powerful way to deepen connections with your followers and turn them into loyal fans! You'll be able to send messages, like event reminders or important updates, directly to your followers' inboxes. Unlike on social media posts, you can include links in your messages.\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nLaunch polls and create prompts to get direct feedback as well as start conversations around specific event topics.\n\n\n\nShare important links (like to your ticketing page!) to drive event registration, ticket sales, and website traffic.\n\n\n\nPromote your broadcast channel through your Instagram Stories and on your live-streams to get more people to join\n\n\n\nCustomize your channel's background to fit your brand and create a compelling space for your community.\n\n\n\nGive your channel a fun name! People can see your channel name when they first land on your profile, so give it a name that makes them want to click.\n\n\n\nSend occasional voice messages from you and your staff to promote an event and genuinely thank your followers for their support. Your community will appreciate this authentic touch!\n\n\n\nSend at least 3 messages a week to boost engagement to your broadcast channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should my event hashtag strategy look like?\n\n\n\nBuilding an effective event hashtag strategy for Instagram is key to leveling up your posts by optimizing them for SEO to relevant search terms. Start with testing different variations using between 1-10 hashtags. Hint: 3-5 hashtags is usually the sweet spot for optimal visibility. Keep your event hashtag short, punchy, and aligned with your event's content. It\u2019s also vital to consider the popularity of each hashtag; a balanced mix is key. Include hashtags with 10K+, 50K+, 100K+, and even 1M+ posts to reach both niche and broader audiences. Incorporating a variety of event-specific hashtags (#PrimaFest) and general ones (like #LiveMusic) can help you gain targeted reach while also building community buzz. And don\u2019t forget to tap into the power of AI event planning tools like ChatGPT to spark creative hashtag ideas for your posts!\n\n\n\nHow can I use Instagram Shop to drive more sales?\n\n\n\nWith 70% of users making purchases from shoppable posts and 50% more likely to buy directly from Instagram, the Instagram Shop feature is a powerhouse for creating an additional revenue stream and expanding your event business. By turning your profile into a digital storefront, you can sell products like your event's merchandise, homemade products, or other branded items while also promoting your ticket sales. For example, a university could offer an easy way for fans of their sports team to buy gear or for students to shop for their favorite campus merch.\n\n\n\nThink of Instagram Shop as an extension of your website, interacting with your community every single day. You can directly link featured products to your posts, making it easier than ever for people to buy what they see and love. Plus, your Instagram page provides a holistic view of your brand so your customers can really get to know who they're buying from. To set up your shop, you\u2019ll need to own your domain URL, have a free professional business account on Instagram, and then build out your catalog of products. An important note: you can't sell things from a third-party site (like your tickets) through Instagram Shop, but you can still promote those links in your bio, on stories, and in your broadcast channel! With Instagram Shop, you\u2019ll have a powerful, integrated sales channel that streamlines the shopping experience for your audience and increases your revenue potential!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I use Instagram ads?\n\n\n\nInstagram ads are a powerful tool for promoting events! This is ideal for event marketing campaign goals like driving ticket sale revenue and selling merchandise. As an event organizer, your Instagram ad goals should be to drive people to your event page to sell more tickets and to earn at least $5 for every $1 spent in ads. If you use ads to just boost the view count on your posts, it\u2019s not as effective in giving you a return on your investment.\n\n\n\nPhoto and video are the two types of Instagram event ads you can create. While it's good to do a mix of both, we recommend focusing on video ads, since they tend to capture your audience's attention more than photos. In fact, it's so powerful that revenue from short-form video ads is expected to surpass $10 billion over this past year! Plus, with seamless integration into the Meta Ads Manager, you can efficiently launch event ads on both Instagram and Facebook, amplifying your event's reach with ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs influencer marketing on Instagram right for my events?\n\n\n\nInfluencer marketing on Instagram can be a game-changer for promoting your events, especially if you partner with micro-influencers (between 10K to 100K followers) and nano-influencers (between 1,000 to 10K followers). These avid content creators often have highly engaged and loyal audiences, making their recommendation of your events more authentic and impactful. To make influencer marketing work for your event, recruit influencers in your niche to create buzz-worthy content like event previews, host giveaways for free tickets or VIP perks, or share behind-the-scenes footage to build excitement leading up to the big day. Plus, influencers with a smaller, dedicated following are not only effective but also a budget-friendly way to expand your event's reach!\n\n\n\nDon't forget that your event attendees are influencers of your brand too! As a key to your event's success, they're the ones who invite friends and family to join them at your unforgettable experiences year after year. Encourage them to take photos and create short videos, then tag you on Instagram in their posts and use your branded event hashtag. This user-generated content is not only free promotion for your event, but it also has a genuine way of resonating with potential attendees!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext level tips for growing on Instagram for an upcoming event\n\n\n\nWith your content strategy solidified, there's some extra things you can do to help set your Instagram up for success! One of the biggest tips is to engage with other accounts. According to Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri, Instagram's algorithms tend to favor accounts that more frequently interact with their followers and push their content more. So, don't be shy when liking, commenting, sharing, and messaging other accounts!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo help level up your content, see what's performing the best for other accounts in your Instagram event niche and let that give you ideas for your posts too. Encourage your attendees, guests, and staff to tag you in anything they post about your events. This is an extremely powerful way to get your event in front of new audiences and hopefully gain more followers.\n\n\n\nYou'll also want to keep your account's bio updated often and use the link in your bio to direct people to your event ticketing page, your website, or a third-party service like Linktree that lets you post multiple links at once. Your ultimate goal is to convert your Instagram followers into excited event-goers, so you'll want to make it as easy as possible to buy their tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a master of Instagram event promotion\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to promote an event on Instagram, it's time to get creative with your posts. And remember, don't overthink it! Social media is an art, not a science. Have fun making content that showcases your events and experimenting until you find what works best for you. The key is to stay consistent with it.\n\n\n\n\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/instagram-on-mobile-device-1024x591.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Of all the event marketing strategies out there, search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the most powerful ways to connect to customers without cutting into your budget. Sounds great, but wondering how to get started? We've put together this complete guide on SEO for event planners to help you do just that!\n\n\n\nBut first, what is SEO?\n\n\n\nSearch engine optimization (aka SEO) is the process of improving your website so that it appears higher in search results, increasing your event's visibility. At any given moment, someone may search Google for upcoming events in your area that interest them. Your goal? Put your event at the top of those search results! This is an essential part of your&nbsp;event marketing strategy&nbsp;because you'll get more people to visit your site, interact with your content, and ultimately buy tickets to your awesome events.\n\n\n\nIt's also important to note that SEO helps your site appear organically in search results. This means your site will naturally generate as a search result, as opposed to using paid search to appear at the top of that page with the word \u201cAd\u201d next to your site.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, let's dive into the practical tips of our SEO guide for event marketing!\n\n\n\n1. Define your target audience\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to determine who you're writing this page for. Depending on who your target audience is, your content should speak directly to what's important to them and match what they're searching for. This specifically means that the keywords you use will likely vary based on your audience and their search intent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, if you're hosting a workshop or class, you may use more professional and industry-related terms. If you're hosting a community-wide event, you'll probably stick to casual, everyday words and phrases. You'll also want to use local terms that people will search for related to your event's location, such as the city, venue name, and region.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Boost your visibility on Google search results\n\n\n\nWhen people search Google for something, the page that appears is called the SERP, which is short for \u201csearch engine results page.\u201d On this SERP are websites Google thinks are relevant to you, displaying the title of each page and a brief description (called the \"meta description\"). The higher your page is on these search results, the more likely a person will click on it. Here are a few ways to help boost your page's performance on this SERP:\n\n\n\nConduct keyword research\n\n\n\nKeywords are the search terms that you want your website to appear for. If you're hosting a pumpkin patch, for example, some relevant keywords might include \u201cpumpkin patch near me,\u201d \u201cpumpkin picking,\u201d or \u201cbest fall events.\u201d Keyword research tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Google Keyword Planner can help you determine what these search terms are for your event. You can also visit your competitors' sites to see what keywords they appear for on Google.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs you do so, you'll also need to consider a person's search intent. Google might relate certain general phrases to more topics than you might expect. For example, if someone searches \u201ctheater events\" looking for musicals or play performances, the SERP might also display movie theater times too. To avoid this, focus on keywords as specific to your event's niche as possible that still have substantial search volume. Pull a list of the best keywords together, so you can include them throughout your website. By matching both the keywords and their search intent, you'll improve your rankings on relevant SERPs and draw in visitors of your ideal audience!\n\n\n\nPerfect your site's title tags and meta descriptions\n\n\n\nYour title tag and meta description are the first thing that users will see when your website appears in their search results \u2013 so make it count! To give you an idea of what we're talking about, here's an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo grab viewers' attention, your title tag (the larger blue text) should be around 60 characters long, incorporate your event's name at the beginning, and have your most important keyword in it somewhere too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust beneath that is a brief summary called the meta description. This should be between 70 to 160 characters long, describe what your event offers, and give potential ticket buyers a call-to-action (CTA) that persuades them to click. Within it, be sure to include at least 1-2 relevant keywords from your previous research above. This last piece is especially important because it directly impacts your click-through rate (CTR), which is the number of people who click on your link out of the total number of people who view it. The higher your CTR is, the better your chance of getting listed higher on the SERP!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Put relevant event details front and center\n\n\n\nOnce you've drawn people into your website, display your event's most important information at the top of the page, including the name, date(s), time(s), and location. Pairing this with an eye-catching photo or video can help draw readers in too (more on this later!). Then, the rest of your page should give the inside scoop on your event. That way, your readers will have everything they need to know for the big day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon't forget to incorporate similar target keywords throughout your copy (similar to the ones in your title tag and meta description) to reinforce the relevancy of your content to Google. Consider adding an FAQ section, your contact info, and social media handles as well.\n\n\n\n4. Make your CTA loud and clear\n\n\n\nBecause your site visitors can click away at any second and your end goal is to sell more tickets, you'll want your CTA button as clear as possible. The easier you make it to buy tickets, the more likely you are to sell more of them! So, add it near the top of the page, use bold colors and font, and insert short but compelling copy to make it stand out. As for the CTA link itself, use a platform like TicketLeap to build an\u00a0irresistible landing page!\n\n\n\n5. Add high-quality links to your event page\n\n\n\nBacklinking is an effective way to build your site's credibility. This means whenever another site links off to your pages, you earn a \u201cbacklink\u201d from them. If you return the favor, then they'll earn backlinks from you too. People may share a link to your website from their social media pages, blogs, news articles, or other reputable sites. Please note, these sources need to be credible. This is because the quality of your backlinks will either help or hurt how search engines think of your site as well.\n\n\n\nTo help with this, don't be afraid to ask people (e.g., your&nbsp;sponsors, performers, and affiliates) to link to your site. Backlinking lets search engines know your site has a great reputation and will, in turn, be more likely to rank your site. Having other websites talk about yours also increases web traffic and introduces your event to more people!\n\n\n\n6. Make the most of your images and videos\n\n\n\nDid you know the images on your site can help you in two different ways? On one hand, using high-quality images and videos from your&nbsp;event photography efforts&nbsp;can help hook new fans in. Using images of attendees having the time of their lives at your past events can make your next event seem irresistible to website visitors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, you can also make your site more accessible by inserting alternative text (alt text) that briefly describes what your images are. This text will appear if your image doesn't load, and it's especially helpful for those who are visually impaired or rely on screen readers. As a search engine crawls your website and decides its search ranking, this provides extra signals regarding how your content ties to relevant search results.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n7. Incorporate structured data\n\n\n\nStructured data, or schema, are snippets of code added to your webpage that tell search engines more about your website. Adding these extra details to your site can help you rank higher on a given SERP. By providing&nbsp;structured data about your event&nbsp;(e.g., date, time, location, and&nbsp;ticket prices), search engines can more easily read your site and display additional search enhancements under your main website, like links to subpages or a map of your event's location. Luckily, with a ticketing platform like TicketLeap, we do this automatically for you on your event listing. As for your actual website, you'll likely want to consult your specific provider on how to include this.\n\n\n\n8. Ensure your site is mobile friendly\n\n\n\nThe majority of website visitors nowadays use their mobile devices, so optimizing your site for mobile is a must. Build your layout so it works as seamlessly on someone's phone as it does on their desktop. Plus, regarding SEO event best practices, Google heavily prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in its ranking system, meaning your freshly optimized site will have a better chance to rank higher!\n\n\n\n9. Track your success!\n\n\n\nMeasure your site's performance to help you determine how you can make it even better! Use Google Analytics, Google Search Console, or other tools to track your performance and conversion rate based on your visitor count. You can also see where people are coming in from to measure the effectiveness of your&nbsp;event marketing&nbsp;campaigns and to see what types of searches your website is appearing for.\n\n\n\nNow that you've made it through our guide on SEO for events, it's time to put it into practice! And remember, there's always room for improvement. Then, once you've got your website tailored for SEO, you'll have an extra leg up on your competition when promoting and&nbsp;selling your tickets!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/649db9537b079bd53b24ca10_packed-concert-with-confetti-scaled-1-1024x572.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

If you scored tickets to a sporting event, concert, or anything in between and can't make it, you might be able to make your money back \u2013 or even sell them for a profit! Learn the basics of ticket resale and how to keep your wallet happy by reselling your event tickets.\n\n\n\nIf you bought tickets to an upcoming concert, festival, or other event and can no longer attend, you might be wondering how to resell them. Or maybe you're a season ticket holder for your favorite sports team but don't plan on attending every game. Whether your event tickets were bought months in advance or the day before, online ticket resellers can help you put your unwanted tickets to good use, and \u2013 if you're lucky \u2013 even turn a profit.\n\n\n\nBefore we dive in, let's review what ticket resale is and how it differs from ticket brokering and scalping.\n\n\n\nWhat is ticket resale?\n\n\n\nTicket resale&nbsp;essentially means that you're reselling a ticket of admission to an event. The tickets are bought from a licensed seller and then sold by the owner of the tickets for whatever price they choose.\n\n\n\nTicket brokering&nbsp;is a type of ticket resale where you buy event tickets in bulk from a licensed seller and then resell them at a higher price. Because most reselling happens online, ticket brokering can sometimes be confused with ticket scalping, but they're very different!\n\n\n\nWhat is ticket scalping?\n\n\n\nTicket scalping&nbsp;is similar to brokering because tickets are bought in bulk, but that's where the similarities end. Scalpers use unfair methods to automate their bulk ticket buying. Specifically, they use bots to make purchases faster than typical customers can. The tickets are then resold at a significantly inflated price, meaning that many excited customers who otherwise would have bought a ticket may not be able to anymore. Not only can this affect the reputation of an event that tickets are being scalped for, but it can also lead to lower attendance rates (and we know you want a packed house!)\n\n\n\nIs ticket scalping illegal?\n\n\n\nAlthough there are no federal laws against ticket scalping, 15 states have banned it in some way. In some of those states, if you're caught scalping, you can be fined and\/or spend up to a year in jail.\n\n\n\nHow ticketing platforms prevent scalping\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of ways that ticketing platforms help event organizers battle unwanted scalpers, and we recommend implementing one or all of these if you're&nbsp;selling tickets online to your own event:\n\n\n\n\nPut a limit on the maximum number of tickets one person can buy\n\n\n\nUse CAPTCHAs so ticket buyers must prove they're human and not a scalper bot\n\n\n\nRequire customers to make an account on your website before purchasing\n\n\n\n\nWhen choosing&nbsp;the right ticketing platform&nbsp;for your event, be sure to ask about their strategies for combating scalpers!\n\n\n\nHow to resell tickets\n\n\n\nNow that we know some basic terms, let's figure out how to resell your extra event tickets so everyone comes out as a winner. First, you'll want to determine your online ticket marketplace options. You may already know some of the most popular places you can resell tickets, like Ticketmaster, StubHub, and SeatGeek, but how do you know which reseller is best for you? Well, the answer depends on the unique aspects of your event, like the type of tickets you're selling, your audience base, fees and payment methods, and much more. But fear not: we're here to guide you through it!\n\n\n\nReselling tickets to concerts and sporting events\n\n\n\nIf you're looking to resell tickets for an in-demand concert, festival, or sporting event, Ticketmaster and StubHub should be the first on your list. These marketplaces are super secure and well known, so you'll have the best chance to sell your tickets&nbsp;at a good price. In some cases, these larger platforms also allow you to sell your parking pass to the buyer, too!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you're trying to sell tickets for smaller events, like a college football game, give ticket resellers like TicketNetwork and Vivid Seats a try. With all of these options, not only can you sell your event tickets with ease, but you can also skip negotiating directly with the ticket buyer entirely!\n\n\n\nSafe and secure ticket resellers\n\n\n\nHere at TicketLeap, we want customers around the world to always have an easy ticket purchase process, fast admission into every event, and an unforgettable experience while they're there. That can't happen if there are\u00a0fake tickets\u00a0floating around! That's why you should always buy and sell tickets on reputable platforms, as most will only resell tickets that are purchased from official, licensed ticket sources.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlus, many of the largest ticket reseller platforms give ticket buyers a \u201cvalid ticket or your money back\u201d guarantee. And if you accidentally sell a fake ticket on one of these sites? You may be liable for charges up to double the amount of the ticket sale price, so always carefully read your ticketing resale marketplace's terms and conditions to make sure you're following all of their rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket reseller fees and payment methods\n\n\n\nIf you're thinking about reselling your event tickets, you're probably hoping to make your money back or even gain a profit. To make sure you're not leaving money on the table, pay close attention to a ticket reseller's fees and payment methods.\n\n\n\nFor example, how will you get paid? Most platforms have a variety of ways to get your money, including through bank transfers, PayPal, or a check. When will you get paid? It often depends on payment type, but your ticket reseller should have detailed information for you. Lastly (and most importantly), what fees are associated with your ticket resale? Generally, the lower the fee, the more money in your pocket. Fees for the ticket reseller could be as low as 0% or all the way up to 15%, so keep that in mind while you crunch the numbers!\n\n\n\nTicket resale FAQs\n\n\n\nCan I list resale tickets on multiple ticketing marketplaces?\n\n\n\nYou&nbsp;can&nbsp;list event tickets on multiple online ticket resale platforms, but you're responsible for fulfilling the ticket sale on each. This is not recommended because there is a risk that you could double-sell your tickets, which would mean you'd be unable to fulfill one of those sales. That could end up costing you double the ticket price or more!\n\n\n\nWhere is the best place to resell tickets?\n\n\n\nThe best place to resell your official event tickets is with a reputable, online ticket reseller marketplace. Make sure you read their ticket seller's terms and conditions and follow all of their rules so you don't lose out on any money.\n\n\n\nIs ticket scalping illegal?\n\n\n\nIt depends on which state you're in. While there are no federal laws against ticket scalping, 15 states have banned the practice in some way.\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/620534007bd53db545a5d91f_ticket-resell-hero-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":52,"name":"Sell Event Tickets","slug":"sell-event-tickets","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":52,"taxonomy":"category","description":"As event organizers everywhere, selling tickets is one of the key components of hosting successful events.

If you're itching to take your events to the next level, posting on TikTok might just be your golden ticket. Whether it's adding your own flair to the latest trends or teaming up with fellow creators, this guide is sure to help your events shine even brighter as they cross users' For You page. Ready to learn more? Let's explore the art of leveraging this powerful social media platform, and kickstart your event promotion on TikTok!\n\n\n\nStrategizing your TikTok event content\n\n\n\nTo get the most out of your TikTok event marketing, you'll want to do a bit of planning first. Depending on what your awesome event is, first you'll need to figure out your TikTok event niche, whether that be festivals, pop-up experiences, haunted houses, or something else. Then, take some time to explore and engage videos from other TikTok creators in that niche. As you do so, note any ideas you come across that you may want to try yourself! You should also jot down any popular hashtags in your niche's posts \u2013 these'll be great additions to your captions later.\n\n\n\nFleshing out your content goals and plan\n\n\n\nAs with any successful&nbsp;event marketing&nbsp;endeavor, you'll want to set some content goals upfront. Are you trying to drive more awareness to your organization as a whole? Or perhaps you're focused on&nbsp;boosting ticket sales&nbsp;for a specific event that's on the calendar? Pinpoint important dates you'll want to draw attention to with your TikToks, such as when you'll unveil your guest lineup, when tickets go on sale, and of course, the big event day. You can also plan the types of videos you'll capture during your events to build FOMO (fear of missing out) for future content.\n\n\n\nTo grow the most on TikTok, consistency is key. To help you with this and to keep track of your target post dates, put together a content calendar to help you schedule when you'll create and post your videos. This'll help you figure out the best times each week to post too. Need some extra hands? Consider inviting some of your&nbsp;event staff&nbsp;in on the fun to help you with your social media!\n\n\n\nHow to create viral-worthy TikTok event content\n\n\n\nTime to get creative and jumpstart your event marketing on TikTok! From the moment you first start filming to when you hit post, we'll show you some key ingredients to setting your posts up for success:\n\n\n\n1. Film high-quality videos\n\n\n\nThe beauty of TikTok is you simply need a phone camera to get started. No fancy equipment required \u2013 unless you want to! That said, make sure to always film your videos vertically and consider using a tripod or asking a friend to help film for you. Similar to capturing high-quality&nbsp;event photography, be mindful of your lighting and use natural light to your advantage as much as possible, ensuring your TikToks always look great. Pro tip: for iPhone users, you can auto-lock your focus and exposure for maximum control of the lighting in your videos.\n\n\n\n2. Hook your viewers\n\n\n\nYou only have between 1-4 seconds to grab your viewers' attention before they keep scrolling, so the hook at the beginning of your video is essential to drawing people in and making them want to watch to the end. This could be a simple yet clever line of text, a voiceover, or an eye-catching video transition (just to name a few). If you're giving advice, mention a numbered list so people watch to hear all the items on your list. Need more ideas? See what other creators are doing in the first three seconds of their videos and draw inspiration from them.\n\n\n\n3. Make engaging content\n\n\n\nWhat helps TikTok push your videos to more people? Having people watch your videos to the end (if not multiple times!) and engaging with your content by liking, commenting, and sharing. To help keep viewers' attention the whole time, your TikToks should ideally be between&nbsp;15-30 seconds&nbsp;long, and no more than 60 seconds. Include quick transitions, effects, and text throughout your videos to keep things interesting. The key is to just be yourself! People will resonate most with your TikTok event content if it's genuine. So, find what works for you and what your audience seems most engaged with, then create more content in that vein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Try some trends\n\n\n\nKeep an eye out for trends, challenges, or memes that you can be a part of! As you scroll through your For You page, save viral videos and trending sounds to use in your own videos. When you film your TikToks, you can also explore trending effects and songs to incorporate as well. Try using hilarious sound bites over your TikTok with a funny caption over the top of it, or create Stitches and Duets with popular videos. TikTok is all about experimenting and trying stuff out, so don't be afraid to put your own twist on popular trends!\n\n\n\n5. Master your captions\n\n\n\nYour TikTok caption serves two purposes. One, it'll help hook viewers into your video, so use emojis, witty phrases, or questions to keep the conversation going in the comments. Two, the text in your caption makes it easier for people to find your videos when they search for related keywords. This is because TikTok has become more of a search engine for content, considering millions of TikToks are posted every day. Therefore, include keywords in your caption and in your TikTok's cover image too. You'll also want to use a geolocation tag to target people in your event's area, and tag any relevant accounts in your TikToks, like your&nbsp;event sponsors!\n\n\n\nBonus tip: Rather than manually post your videos, you're now able to upload and&nbsp;schedule your TikToks&nbsp;on your desktop!\n\n\n\nUtilizing TikTok paid ads\n\n\n\nWant to kick your TikTok event marketing up a notch? In addition to posting organic content, you can launch paid TikTok ads after creating a business account. By doing so, you'll be able to better target viewers in your event's niche and&nbsp;boost your ticket sales. A particularly powerful tool that TikTok has is its&nbsp;Creator Marketplace. This allows you to partner with TikTok influencers who already have an established fanbase of over 10,000 followers who can help you promote your events. They could hype up your events, offer exclusive&nbsp;discount codes&nbsp;to your tickets, wear your event merch in their videos, and more. You could even invite influencers to come to your event and document their experience. That way, they can share it with their adoring fans, or maybe even share it live!\n\n\n\nTikTok Lives\n\n\n\nThe live streaming feature is a hidden gem of TikTok! By regularly going live, ideally 1-2 times per week, you give your event's TikTok account the chance to reach even more people and interact one-on-one with your followers. For each livestream, set a Live goal to encourage viewers to give you\u00a0Live Gifts\u00a0as a token of their appreciation (and as an extra revenue stream!). For your lives, try hosting Q&amp;A sessions, going behind the scenes at your venue, playing fun games with your special guests backstage, doing an interactive workshop, inviting your artists to play some live music, and more. You could also live stream snippets of your event day on TikTok to increase that FOMO for people who aren't there. You could partner with your sponsors, special guests, and other TikTok creators to bring some new energy to your live streams too! Plus, by going live within 1-2 hours of posting a TikTok, you'll help drive more views and engagement to that video.\n\n\n\n(Bonus!) More best practices\n\n\n\nThat's not all! Similar to your&nbsp;Instagram marketing strategy, you should regularly post quick images or video clips to your TikTok stories (they'll stay up for only 24 hours). As a simple yet powerful way to build engagement on your posts, dedicate some time to engaging with other content and creators in your TikTok event niche by liking, commenting, following, etc. Encourage your attendees to create TikToks at your events and to tag you in them. You may even consider hosting a contest for people who post TikToks they've made at your events or use a campaign-specific hashtag!\n\n\n\n\u200d\n\n\n\nNow you're better equipped than ever to tackle your TikTok event marketing! Remember, every social media platform requires a unique strategy, so your approach to achieving these goals on TikTok will differ from how you tackle other platforms like&nbsp;or Instagram. Social media is all about trying out tons of ideas until you find something that sticks and builds your fanbase of loyal event-goers, so have fun experimenting!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64f0bdb022552e352f7f56b1_concert-crowd-with-pink-blue-lights-scaled-1-1024x729.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Your audience is always on the lookout for a unique, affordable, and fun way to get out, so why not show them what your drive-in movie theater is all about? As you prepare for your next drive-in movie event, follow our tips to make sure your attendees not only have a great time, but will become repeat customers ready for a sequel!\n\n\n\n1. Host movie nights around upcoming holidays\n\n\n\n\u200d Hosting holiday movie nights is a great way to drive more traffic to your drive-in, as many potential attendees will be actively looking for ways to celebrate. Whether you're ushering in spooky season with Halloween classics like\u00a0Hocus Pocus\u00a0and\u00a0Beetlejuice, Christmastime festivities with\u00a0A Christmas Story\u00a0or\u00a0It's a Wonderful Life, or even some romantic comedies ahead of Valentine's Day, matching your movie selections with the time of the year is a great way to regularly draw in crowds.\n\n\n\n2. Take an audience poll\n\n\n\n\u200d Embrace the power of the people! Send a questionnaire or survey to past attendees and on social media to help determine what kind of drive-in movie set up they would like to see next. Questions about their favorite movies, directors, genres, and more can help curate your selection and make&nbsp;planning your next roster of movies&nbsp;easier than ever! Remember: understanding your audience and showing them what they want is a big part of how to host a drive-in movie successfully!\n\n\n\n3. Offer special discount nights\n\n\n\n\u200d Use your historical ticketing data to discover what your most attended days and times usually are. To drive more attendance to days that typically see a lower turnout, like during the week, offer a special discount. For example, by offering half-priced tickets for matinees or a free drink on Wednesday night showings, you'll bring in more moviegoers who can't pass up a deal, while working within your event pricing strategy.\n\n\n\n4. Host \u201cThrowback Thursday\u201d nights\n\n\n\n\u200d Empower your attendees to go back in time to different eras of cinema by hosting throwback movie nights centered around different decades. Whether you're showcasing the silent movies of early cinema or the beginning of blockbusters in the \u201870s and \u201880s, you'll not only use the history of film to make your events a must-see, but you'll also entice attendees from all generations to visit. Plus, maybe they'll even learn more about the history of some of their favorite classics!\n\n\n\n5. Present director-focused specials\n\n\n\n\u200d Whether it's the tenth time or the hundred-and-tenth time, dedicated movie fans love seeing their favorite directors on the big screen! Hosting director-focused nights is a great theme that can appeal to hardcore fans and newer ones who are interested in dipping their toe into filmography. No matter if it's their latest release, their underrated gem, or the one that put them on the map, great directors have dozens of films you can choose from. You could even bring in local indie directors to present their films with an Q&amp;A session, then discuss how to do a drive-in movie showcase for indie films.\n\n\n\n6. Stock up on fan-favorite snacks\n\n\n\n\u200d You can't have an unforgettable drive-in movie set up without some snacks! In addition to your general ticket sales, selling concessions onsite is a great way to make more money for your organization. Plus, who doesn't like something to munch on during their favorite movie? Whether it's the classic candy and popcorn combo, or fan-favorite snacks like slushies and licorice, make sure you stock up so all your moviegoers can get what they need to prepare for a great viewing experience! And if you need some manpower to manage your concession stand, consider&nbsp;hiring additional staff&nbsp;for your drive-in movie so you can save time and focus on the big picture (no pun intended).\n\n\n\n7. Promote your upcoming screenings\n\n\n\n\u200d Use every tool at your disposal to&nbsp;get the word out&nbsp;about your upcoming showings, especially free mediums like social media and&nbsp;email. You can post movie times, testimonials from satisfied customers, and links to your website, so your followers know just what to expect after they buy tickets. Plus, a recurring email newsletter with special deals is a great way to further your reach and make sure moviegoers know how awesome your drive-in is.\n\n\n\n8. Work with an easy-to-use ticketing solution\n\n\n\nMake the purchase process easier than ever and drive more advanced ticket sales by working with a user-friendly ticketing platform. With a platform like&nbsp;TicketLeap, you can get your tickets on sale in minutes, offer&nbsp;different price levels, and easily track your inventory. And with our full-feature set and resource guides, you'll have everything you need to learn how to host a drive-in movie that stands out from the rest and keep moviegoers rolling in!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6390c571f117a018f4a6d790_drive-in-4-alt-1024x538.png","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

Check out our tips to set a foundation for your event publicity.\n\n\n\nPut away your books, it's test time! Don't worry, the answers are right below the questions, so you can learn as you go.\n\n\n\nWe've never met an event planner who would turn down coverage, but getting press is not as easy as it sounds. Test your knowledge on what you need to do to put together the foundation of a publicity plan that will put your event in front of more editors, who can, in turn, boost your event promotion to more people.\n\n\n\nIf a press release is going to be successful, how should it be written?\n\n\n\n\nLike the great American novel, to tell the entire story of the event from conception to fruition!\n\n\n\nLike a scientific fact sheet, void of inspiration. Clinical.\n\n\n\nFlowery, lyrical with a dash of science fiction thrown in\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all of these \n\n\n\n\nANSWER: Writing a press release is an art form in itself. If you've never written a press release before, don't sweat it. They sound a little intimidating, but ultimately they're an information piece that makes sure the reader has all the pertinent information on your event, plus a few highlights to peak the reader's interest. They're short and sweet, and when you go the extra mile to make your press release great, it can lead to big things like interviews in newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, and possibly television.\n\n\n\nHOT TIP: When you're crafting the perfect press release, remember the people reading aren't your event attendees, they're members of the media or the press. That means your press release is your chance to pitch your angle, and there's no room for modesty in there! Does your main speaker have an Olympic Gold medal? Talk about it! Has your headliner performed in dozens of countries around the world? Throw that in there! Did your event planners produce that other awesome thing last summer in the park? Ya, she did! Anything about your event that makes it different, make sure you pitch it.\n\n\n\nWhat else should you include in your press release?\n\n\n\n\nYour contact information\n\n\n\nA poster about your event\n\n\n\nA meme people might find funny\n\n\n\nA photo from past events to give context\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: All of the above except C. Your press release is a tool to make writing about your event as easy as humanly possible. Editorial staff in newsrooms and print houses are notoriously overworked, so providing a document that has all the tools for them to create a story will make it far more likely that they write about your event. Including a visual like a poster or a photo will not only give them an idea of the spirit of your event branding and style of your event, they can also include that in their piece. Your contact information, we consider that a no brainer, but we'd blame ourselves if you forgot to add it in!\n\n\n\nIf you were building a media list to send your press release, who would you add to it?\n\n\n\n\nLocal blogger\n\n\n\nNews anchor\n\n\n\nInfluencers\n\n\n\nRadio stations\n\n\n\nCommunity Websites\n\n\n\nLocal Editors\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: All of the above - and probably more. It's not about having a concise list; it's about having a definitive list. If you're putting on a concert or festival, don't send your press release to the reporter who covers City Hall - this is about sending it to people who have a direct correlation to your event, and whose readers will be interested to hear more about what you're doing.\n\n\n\nIf you're using social media to get a little publicity, which strategies should you use?\n\n\n\n\nSend a message to everyone you think might be interested in your event, and even people who might not be on your social media platforms.\n\n\n\nPost your press release and include a relevant hashtag\n\n\n\nFind Facebook Groups where people can pitch stories\n\n\n\nGet lost watching videos of baby otters on X and every half hour or so, remind yourself what you should be doing instead\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: Heed our warning - answer A almost never works. In fact, sometimes it fails so hard, it has the opposite effect intended, and people purposely ignore your event. To connect with the press on social media, incorporate a little bit of B and C for a proactive, but not overwhelming approach (we've tried getting coverage through answer D, but it's never worked)\n\n\n\nYou've booked an interview with the media! You should:\n\n\n\n\nRehearse your \"No Comment\" strategies and answers to hypothetical questions that may never arise\n\n\n\nRehearse your key talking points and eliminate words such as \"umm\" and \"like\" from your answers\n\n\n\nStop everything, go to the mall and buy a whole new outfit\n\n\n\nCall everyone you know and tell them to watch\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: Well, this one we made pretty obvious only because if you've just booked your first television, radio or print interview, you might be nervous. Relax and spend time every day rehearsing your talking points. What is your event, who is your event for, why are you organizing your event, when is your event, and where can people get tickets? Rehearse those things over and over in your mind until you feel extra confident about your answers. You'll find that even if you have butterflies in your stomach during your interview, it will go better than you expected because the words will flow out of your mouth.\n","date":"17 Aug 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/61f43062f5488e431a28cc62_5dd2d3bdd5cda65e968cae42_austin-distel-PkS3hCZmYts-unsplash-p-2600-scaled-1-1024x704.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

The answer is absolutely yes! However, hosting a private event with friends is much different from a huge community-wide party, so make sure your specific type of event abides by all the local laws. Here are some clear guidelines to help you serve wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages the right way!\n\n\n\nDo you need a liquor license to serve alcohol?\n\n\n\nIf you're selling alcohol (which is a solid way to make money at your event!), then yes, you will need a license. Or, if you're selling tickets and serving alcohol, like at a paint and sip, a liquor license is required. It's super important to determine how to obtain the proper licensing while you\u2019re planning your event, so you can go into your event day with confidence.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to know is that liquor licenses vary by state. This means, while we may not have one perfect answer for you, we can give you directions on how to secure a liquor license in your region. Some states make it much easier to understand than others. For example, Oregon's legal definition is a great place to start. According to their website, licensing is required at your event when:\n\n\n\n\n\u200bAlcohol will be sold.\u200b\n\n\n\nAlcohol is available (but not being sold), and you are charging or accepting donations for admission.\n\n\n\nAny type of payment is required to attend the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you don't need a liquor license for an event\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Oregon's website states that a liquor license is not needed at special events where you are making alcohol available, but there is no payment or purchase required, and no donations of money are accepted (e.g., for alcohol, for entry, for admission, or for any other product or service at the event).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis can include serving alcohol at a private event like a wedding reception where guests can enjoy some booze, but you don't require payment or purchase and don't accept donations.\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, contact your state's liquor board through their government website and explain what your needs are, so you can determine what documentation to file to receive your appropriate liquor permit. Do you know other event organizers in your community? Ask them how they got their temporary permit for serving alcohol in your specific region.\n\n\n\nState variations in liquor licenses\n\n\n\nKeep in mind, there are subtle differences between states. For example, in Indiana, you can only get a license for beer and wine. If you want to serve liquor, you need a licensed caterer.\n\n\n\nCounties within the same state may even have varying laws depending on if they are \"wet\", \"dry\", or \"moist\". A wet county allows the sale of alcohol while a dry country prohibits all sale of alcohol. A moist county, however, permits the sale of alcoholic beverages in certain situations. Additionally, there may be different policies regarding for profit events versus those hosted by nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n\nTo confirm what happens in your state, search \u201ctemporary liquor license for an event\u201d on Google and then type in your state or city. You'll need to use those exact words, because a \u201cspecial event license\u201d is a separate type of license, and your event likely won't need that. If you are hosting your event somewhere that already has a liquor license and using their staff, you will not need a separate license.\n\n\n\nHow much do liquor licenses cost?\n\n\n\nThis varies heavily by state. Usually, this will range within a few hundred dollars. For example, California's license costs $50-75 per day, or their special temporary license is $100. Luckily, because you're only needing a temporary permit as an event, it won't cost nearly as much for you as it would for a restaurant purchasing an annual license for their alcohol served.\n\n\n\nAlternative ways to serve alcohol without getting a permit\n\n\n\nWanting to serve alcohol at your event, but wanting to skip securing a liquor license? When selecting your event venue, prioritize options that offer bar services. If they let you run a cash bar, attendees can purchase alcohol straight from the venue, saving you from having to purchase drinks at all as the organizer.\n\n\n\nIf the venue doesn\u2019t have a bar service, consider hiring a professional caterer! They\u2019ve already obtained a license to serve food and drink, and your venue is their \u201clicensed premises\u201d. You\u2019ll need to check with them of any requirements like a percentage of food sales required in proportion to drink sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of event insurance\n\n\n\nNow that we've got that sorted, event insurance is the next important piece to the puzzle. Lucky for you, once you've got a liquor license, this is going to seem easy! For any event, but especially those with alcohol, it's wise to have event insurance. Even venues that already have a liquor license will probably ask you to get additional event insurance. This is easy to do. Call up your regular insurance provider and they will give you a quote. You can also do this online. The cost will range from about $75 to a few hundred dollars, depending on if you\u2019re a small event with no alcohol versus looking for around $1 or $2 million in event insurance. Keep in mind, if you\u2019re serving alcohol, you\u2019ll need to include liquor liability coverage.\n\n\n\nCheers to hosting your next event with confidence!\n\n\n\nThat's it! You're all set to secure a liquor license (and your event insurance!) for your upcoming events. As you build your event page, keep in mind to clarify in your event description if you're serving alcohol and have any age restrictions on who can attend. With TicketLeap's full suite of features, you can include custom questions in the purchase process to learn more about your attendees (e.g., how many are of drinking age) and even embed a waiver at checkout for them to sign too. Now, go forth and toast your newfound knowledge with a signature cocktail at your event!\n\n\n\n\n","date":"17 Aug 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/61f7edccf8f2a640347a5e62_5e3988adcf71116969bfdf07_priscilla-du-preez-W3SEyZODn8U-unsplash-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

Whether it's encouraging genuine conversations, bonding with your community over shared experiences, or fundraising for local mental health organizations, these kinds of events are a great launchpad for impacting mental health causes. If you're looking for mental health awareness month activities or just mental health event ideas, here's a list of ways to create super fun experiences that also can benefit your attendees' well-being.\n\n\n\n1. Art fair&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTeam up with local artists to share their beautiful artwork with your community and gain a range of rich perspectives that can truly resonate with your attendees. Set up QR codes that provide insightful descriptions of each piece and allow your artists to share the personal stories behind their creations. Plus, encourage your attendees to express themselves creatively by offering interactive opportunities, like painting stations or guided pottery workshops. You can even utilize donation booths to advocate and&nbsp;fundraise&nbsp;for mental health initiatives in your area!\n\n\n\n2. Hackathon\n\n\n\nThis is an especially well-suited&nbsp;college event idea&nbsp;for STEM majors! Bring together a mix of incredible talent, from tech wizards to creative designers, to collaborate with mental health experts. Through your event, separate your competitors into teams to develop and pitch tech solutions that'll make a difference (i.e., mobile apps for on-the-go support or wearables that inspire well-being). As they brainstorm, be sure your venue is equipped with ample charging stations and keep the energy flowing with nourishing refreshments to fuel those creative minds. To take this event to the next level,&nbsp;sell tickets online&nbsp;to your local community to come cheer on the hackathon competition and have the proceeds help fund the winning idea!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Nature retreat&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScout out a serene location like a lush forest, calm lakeside, or cozy mountain hideaway to host a relaxing nature retreat! Offer a blend of experiences like yoga sessions, meditation journeys, hikes, and stress management workshops. To foster a safe and supportive environment, recruit some expert instructors who can help guide your attendees on their wellness journey. As an extra touch, consider assembling event swag bags with self-care essentials and other useful items for your attendees to take home with them.\n\n\n\n4. Culinary workshop&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStir up an empowering (and delicious!) experience that's not only about cooking, but also about nurturing your mental health. Work with talented chefs to show your attendees how to embrace the art of cooking as a way to practice mindfulness. They'll walk your attendees through irresistible recipes while emphasizing the importance of using fresh, nutritious ingredients. Hungry yet? As their meals are sizzling in the pan or roasting in the oven, sprinkle in some insights on how certain foods can impact your mood. By the end, your attendees will feel accomplished and become more mindful throughout the cooking process.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Film festival&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHandpick a mix of captivating documentaries, short films, and movies that cast a fresh spotlight on topics related to mental health. Secure an inviting venue with suitable projection and sound accommodations for an immersive cinematic experience. On your&nbsp;event's big day, invite your attendees, participating filmmakers, and mental health advocates in your community to make their way down your red carpet to your festival. Before the films play, let your filmmakers share a brief backstory behind their films. Then, as the credits roll, host Q&amp;A sessions with the creators to dive deeper. You could even give your attendees a guide to help ignite meaningful post-screening conversation. To top the night off, consider contributing proceeds from your ticket sales or collecting donations for a local non-profit organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Community mural project&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCapture the strength of overcoming adversity through painting a mural in your community. First,\u00a0select a venue\u00a0with enough wall space and ensure you've gained the necessary permissions to paint in that location. Next, gather a team of enthusiastic artists to help sketch out the mural concept and map it onto your wall. Once you've solidified your design, host mural painting days to invite your whole community to help paint designated sections of the project. That way, locals of all ages can join in the fun \u2013 no artistic skills required! As your mural takes shape, make sure to take lots of\u00a0event photos. That way, you can share them on social media to help create a buzz and rally more support for your cause. Then, once you're finished, organize a mural unveiling event to bring people together to celebrate your masterpiece and what it represents.\n\n\n\n7. Mental health panel and workshop series&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAssemble a panel of mental health experts, from psychologists to therapists, to ignite conversations around the subject. As you brainstorm your mental health workshop ideas, opt for a unifying theme like \u201cCoping Strategies for Everyday Wellness\u201d or \u201cCultivating Mindfulness Together.\u201d Feature local mental health organizations by offering them&nbsp;sponsorship opportunities, fundraising for their cause, or letting them share about their community impact during your panels. Offer thought-provoking Q&amp;A sessions, interactive exercises, and workshops on practicing mindfulness, navigating burnout, and more. You may even consider&nbsp;live streaming&nbsp;or offering&nbsp;virtual panels&nbsp;to make your event even more accessible to a wider range of attendees. By the end, you're sure to leave your participants with practical tools for improving their personal well-being!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Charity concert\n\n\n\nInvite talented musicians to perform for an evening and help raise awareness for mental health. To set the stage, decorate your concert venue with string lights and cozy seating arrangements. During the concert, allow your artists the opportunity to share the stories behind their songs and how their music has helped them through adversity. For a more personal touch, you could even offer valuable resources such as pamphlets on mental health and ways to donate to related nonprofit organizations. Depending on how many artists you have, you could also try hosting a writers' round where songwriters share the stage and take turns playing their songs in support of your event's cause.\n\n\n\n9. Pet &amp; play\n\n\n\nBy merging the therapeutic power of pets with mental wellness, this puppy-filled event is sure to leave a paw-sitive impact on all your participants (pun intended!). For this, partner with local animal shelters or pet therapy organizations to connect their adorable furry friends with your event-goers. Choose a serene outdoor venue or a spacious indoor space to accommodate both pets and people comfortably. Then, let your attendees cut loose to play with their animals, go on a brief walk with them, or even do some pet-friendly guided meditation.&nbsp;Encourage attendees to bring their own pets too (or adopt one of the shelter's pets!) and chat with fellow animal lovers about the mental health benefits of pet companionship.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReady to turn your vision into reality?

From catering to entertainment, vendors play a crucial role in shaping your attendee experience. But with so many options out there, how do you find the right ones? Our team is here to show you how to find and pick event vendors!\n\n\n\nTypes of vendors for events\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into how to find event vendors, let\u2019s break down the types of event vendors you might need when planning an event.\n\n\n\n\nCatering services: Ensure your guests are well-fed with food and beverage options that fit your event\u2019s style and budget.\n\n\n\nAudio\/Visual (A\/V) providers: Set the stage with sound systems, lighting, microphones, and projectors to ensure your programming and entertainment run smoothly.\n\n\n\nPhotography and videography: Capture key moments and create content for social media and future promotional efforts.\n\n\n\nFloral designers: Elevate the ambiance of your venue with fresh floral arrangements and decorations.\n\n\n\nEntertainment providers: Book performers, DJs, or speakers to set the energy and keep your attendees engaged.\n\n\n\nFurniture and equipment rental: Secure essentials like chairs, tables, tents, and staging to create your ideal floor layout.\n\n\n\nTransportation services: Help your guests arrive comfortably with shuttles, buses, or valet services.\n\n\n\nEvent security:&nbsp; Hire experienced personnel to monitor your event\u2019s safety and ensure it's a secure environment for all attendees.\n\n\n\n\nHow are vendors different from sponsors?\n\n\n\nVendors provide services in exchange for payment, whereas sponsors contribute funds, products, or services in exchange for brand exposure. However, sometimes a vendor can also be a sponsor by offering a discount or complimentary service in exchange for marketing opportunities at your event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to find vendors for an event\n\n\n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the types of services your event might need, let\u2019s get into the practical tips on how to find and pick the best event vendors!\n\n\n\n1. Define your specific vendor needs first\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, create a list of the vendors you actually need and will plan to reach out to. Consider the size of your event, the number of attendees, your event theme, and attendees\u2019 expectations. Your event budget should also be a primary factor \u2014 prioritize essential services while considering what extra expenses are worth it to elevate the experience. For example, a live artist painting scenes from your event could add a unique touch, or a specialty dessert station could create a memorable experience for attendees. Interactive experiences like photo booths or custom merchandise stations can also add an extra layer of fun!\n\n\n\n2. Tap into your network\n\n\n\nReferrals are extremely valuable when it comes to finding reliable vendors. As a solid place to start, ask fellow event organizers and venue managers for recommendations, since they often have a go-to list of trusted vendors. Reach out to past vendors you\u2019ve worked with for referrals too. Join industry groups, local event vendor associations, or chamber of commerce groups to expand your connections. You also can\u2019t go wrong with exploring Facebook Groups and LinkedIn for even more vendor recommendations in your industry.\n\n\n\n3. Research and vet vendors thoroughly\n\n\n\nEvery vendor comes with its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so take the time to vet them properly. Read online reviews on Google, Yelp, and industry-specific forums. Review their portfolio to see if their past events align with your vision. Wanting to research even further? Ask for references from previous clients to hear about their experiences firsthand.\n\n\n\n4. Attend local events &amp; expos\n\n\n\nSeeing vendors in action can help you make the right decision! Attend local live events similar to yours, observe the vendors working onsite, and learn firsthand how they operate. Take notes on their booth setups, product displays, and quality of service to assess if they\u2019d perform well at your events too. If possible, you should also check out any industry expos and trade shows going on to network with tons of vendors in one place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Interview vendors like a pro\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your list of vendors, it\u2019s time to schedule interviews with each of them to discuss the details. Key topics to ask them about include their availability on your event date, pricing, setup logistics, and cancellation policies. Ask questions about their experience with similar events and clarify what\u2019s included in their contract. Most importantly, always get everything in writing to ensure there are clear expectations on pricing, deliverables, and responsibilities between you and your vendors.\n\n\n\n6. Negotiate strategically&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSmart negotiation tactics can ensure you\u2019re getting the best value from your vendors and stay within your event budget. When negotiating with prospective vendors, be upfront about your budget and compare their offer against what other vendors are offering you and what you understand of the industry rates. As another way to cut costs, ask for package deals or bundled services. You could also offer marketing exposure, such as social media shoutouts or branding opportunities, in exchange for discounts.\n\n\n\n7. Plan for vendor backup options\n\n\n\nEven the best-laid plans can take an unexpected turn, so it\u2019s always a good idea to have backup vendors. Create a shortlist of alternative companies to contact in case any of your current vendors cancel. It\u2019s also super important that you discuss any cancellation policies in your deals to hopefully avoid this from happening in the first place. Ideally, you want to partner with vendors who are transparent with you about their contingency plans, such as extra staff or backup equipment, to avoid any last-minute mishaps.\n\n\n\n8. Build long-term vendor relationships\n\n\n\nBuilding long-term relationships with high-quality vendors is essential! Start by setting clear, professional expectations so everyone\u2019s on the same page right from the start. Then, treat your vendors like true partners. For example, share behind-the-scenes info about your event goals or challenges they can help solve. When they knock it out of the park, show your appreciation! Rebook them for future events and spread the word about their services to others in your network. You can also give back by offering testimonials about their company or sharing a glowing social media shoutout. These simple gestures not only help them grow their business but also ensure they stay excited to work with you year after year.\n\n\n\nSealing the deal&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinding the right event vendors takes research, networking, and a little negotiation \u2014\u00a0 when done right, it makes a huge difference in the success of your event! Start early, vet thoroughly, and invest intentionally into your vendor relationships for smoother event planning down the line.\n\n\n\nAs a trusted ticketing vendor for over 20 years, thousands of events use TicketLeap to sell tickets online and manage their events, and get paid fast. By partnering with TicketLeap, you can easily sell tickets, manage registrations, and streamline your event planning process!\n","date":"12 Mar 2025","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/AdobeStock_1198825870-1024x574.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

When it comes to selling tickets on your ticketing platform, you\u2019re handling sensitive financial details that need to be locked down tight. That\u2019s where two-factor authentication (2FA) comes in. Sure, it might take an extra few seconds to complete your login, but those moments are a small price in exchange for the peace of mind you\u2019ll gain knowing your account is secure from hackers and other bad actors.\n\n\n\nWhat is two-factor authentication and why do I need it?\n\n\n\nBecause of the large amounts of attendee data, events are a perfect target for phishing attacks. This includes the data and financial information housed in your ticketing platform. At TicketLeap, we want to secure your account to prevent your account from getting into the wrong hands. What\u2019s one important way we prevent this? We make sure your account has two-factor authentication!\n\n\n\nEven with a super complex password, your account is still at risk without this extra barrier of protection. Two-factor authentication requires you to verify your login with a code sent to an external device. That way, even if someone cracked your password, your account is still safe!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Cyber Defense Agency, the use of 2FA on your accounts makes you 99% less likely to be hacked. At the end of the day, this extra layer or protection is a critical element to keeping your online accounts secure. Opting against using 2FA puts both you and your accounts at significant risk.\n\n\n\nHow does two-factor authentication work on TicketLeap?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s simple! You can set up two-factor authentication in just minutes and choose to receive a code when you log in through either text or an authentication app such as Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile. If multiple people need access to your account (we\u2019ll talk more about this in a second), an authentication app may be the best option for you. If you want to learn more about how our 2FA feature works, visit this help article!\n\n\n\nHow to make your login more efficient while staying secure\n\n\n\nWanting to avoid entering a code every time you log into your account? When you log in from a private computer or mobile device (such as your personal laptop or phone), just click the \u201cRemember Me\u201d box at the bottom of the login form. This will keep you logged in for the next 30 days. Keep in mind however, if you have your settings to delete cookies when closing your browser, this feature will not work.\n\n\n\nWhat if multiple staff members need to access your account?\n\n\n\nTicketLeap is a powerful ticketing system with role-based permissions that you can assign to your team members. That way, each person in your organization should have their own login credentials and specialized view of your account. Depending on the type of role they\u2019re assigned, some roles will require two-factor authentication while others won\u2019t. This will be important to coordinate, especially to ensure everyone who does need two-factor authentication can access it.\n\n\n\nOnly users with the following roles require two-factor authentication to be enabled:\n\n\n\n\nOwner accounts (the account that created the organization)\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\nFinance\n\n\n\n\nIf certain staff members don\u2019t need access to the financial portions of our TicketLeap (e.g., payouts, bank account info), then you can give them one or more of the following roles to skip two-factor authentication:\n\n\n\n\nEvents Manager: This role helps create and update event listings, including creating and editing events, changing the privacy settings, updating your fees and sales tax, and creating or modifying discounts.\n\n\n\nBox Office Manager: This role deals with your ticket buyers and attendees, including scanning and selling tickets onsite, running reports, managing order details, issuing refunds, and processing ticket exchanges.\n\n\n\nTicket Check-In: This role just has access to our mobile ticket scanning app and your attendees report.\n\n\n\nTicket Sales: This role has access to our box office feature on desktop and our ticket selling app.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if you use TicketLeap features regularly but don\u2019t typically need access to your payment settings or sales report, you can create one of these user accounts for yourself to manage your day-to-day tasks without needing 2FA to log in.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nQuick tip: You can set up a user with multiple permissions as needed. For example, a user that has both Events Manager and Box Office Manager roles.\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts on two-factor authentication\n\n\n\nAs event organizers, we know your focus is on creating unforgettable experiences for your audiences \u2014 but safeguarding your business is just as important. While two-factor authentication might take a few extra seconds during login, it\u2019s a small investment of time that\u2019s worth the immense security it brings. Protecting your accounts from unauthorized access ensures your financial information, attendee data, and event details stay secure for years to come!\n","date":"6 Mar 2025","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/03\/person-using-two-factor-authentication-on-laptop-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

They search something like \u201cconcerts near me\u201d, then your event pops up at the top of the local search results. That\u2019s the power of local SEO! Local search engine optimization (or local SEO for short) helps your event get discovered by people who are actively looking for something to do nearby. The best part? It can significantly boost your ticket sales and attendance for free! In this guide, we\u2019ll walk you through everything you need to know to optimize your event for local search and maximize your visibility.\n\n\n\nWhat is local SEO for events, and how does it work?\n\n\n\nLocal search engine optimization (SEO) is all about making sure your event appears in location-based searches on search engines like Google or Bing. Unlike general SEO for events, which targets a broader audience, local SEO focuses on connecting with people searching for events near them.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. In their chosen search engine, people use location-specific terms like \u201clive music near me\u201d or \u201ccharity run in Tampa\u201d to find events happening around them. To show up in these searches, your event details need to be optimized for discovery, which includes structuring your website correctly and getting listed on the right platforms. Additionally, while Google is the dominant player, people also search for events on Apple Maps, Bing, and social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. With this in mind, you\u2019ll want to make sure you optimize your event\u2019s local SEO for these platforms too.\n\n\n\nHow do you set up a Google Business Profile for an event?\n\n\n\nA Google Business Profile (GBP) is an essential first step to get your event to appear in Google Search and on Google Maps. It helps increase your event\u2019s visibility, makes it easier for local attendees to find key details like location and ticketing, and boosts credibility through reviews and engagement. Here\u2019s how to set it up:\n\n\n\n\nGo to Google Business Profile and create an account.\n\n\n\nChoose the right category: If your event has a fixed venue, select categories like \u201cEvent Venue\u201d or \u201cLive Music Venue.\u201d If it\u2019s a one-time event, create a profile under your organization and list the event separately.\n\n\n\nFill in accurate event details: Add the event name, date, time, location, ticketing link, and contact details.\n\n\n\nUpload high-quality images: Selecting a compelling cover image and relevant event photos will make your listing stand out.\n\n\n\nEncourage reviews and interactions: Positive reviews increase your credibility and help your event rank higher in search results.\n\n\n\nUse Google Posts: Regularly update your business profile on Google with event announcements, ticket sales info, and special offers. Your posts can appear in Google Search, Google Maps, and Google Business Profile website.\n\n\n\n\nHow can you optimize your event website for local search?\n\n\n\nBy implementing key SEO tactics, you can improve your site\u2019s visibility and attract more local traffic. Here are a few ways to enhance your event website for local search:\n\n\n\nCreate a dedicated landing page\n\n\n\nAn SEO-friendly page is well-structured, easy to navigate, and contains all the essential details, including the event\u2019s name, date, location, ticket info, and keywords that help search engines understand what the page is about.\n\n\n\nEmbed Google Maps\n\n\n\nEmbedding Google Maps onto your website makes it easier for attendees to find your event and reinforces your event\u2019s location to search engines. You can do this by going to Google Maps, searching for your venue, clicking \u201cShare,\u201d then selecting \u201cEmbed a map\u201d and copying the provided HTML code into your event webpage.\n\n\n\nUse schema markup\n\n\n\nEvent schema is a structured data format that helps search engines understand the details of your event and allows you to have a more rich appearance in search results. Implementing it involves adding JSON-LD structured data to your event\u2019s website or ticketing page, which includes fields like event name, date, time, location, and ticketing URL. If you use an event ticketing solution like TicketLeap, your ticketing page will automatically have this for you.\n\n\n\nEnsure your site is optimized for mobile devices\n\n\n\nA mobile-friendly website loads quickly, adjusts to different screen sizes, and provides a smooth user experience. Google\u2019s Page Speed Insights can help check your site\u2019s performance on mobile devices.\n\n\n\nOptimize titles and meta descriptions\n\n\n\nInclude your event name and location in your page title, headers, and event descriptions to improve search engine rankings and click-through rates.\n\n\n\nWhy is it important to keep your event details consistent across all platforms?\n\n\n\nKeeping your event details consistent across all platforms is essential for local SEO and making sure your event is easy to find. Whether it's on your event\u2019s ticketing website like TicketLeap or niche directories like Songkick for concerts, having the same details everywhere builds trust with both search engines and your audience. Make sure things like the event name, date, time, venue, and ticket options match up across all platforms. Staying consistent helps improve your local search rankings and makes it easier for attendees to get the info they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you use local keywords to attract more attendees?\n\n\n\nThe right keywords help people find your event! Find the best keywords by using tools like Google Keyword Planner and Google Trends to identify phrases related to your event like \u201cfood festival near me\u201d, \u201cconcerts in Salt Lake City\u201d, or \u201ccharity run in Detroit.\u201d Then, place those keywords strategically on your website by using them in your titles, meta descriptions, headers (H1s), alt text for images, and event descriptions.\n\n\n\nHere is a brief description for each optimized local SEO element and an example of what each might look like for a food festival in Austin, TX:\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The title is the clickable headline that appears in search engine results. It should be concise, include the event name and location, and entice users to click.\n\nExample: \"Food Festival in Austin \u2013 Best Local Eats &amp; Live Music\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta description: This is the short summary that appears below the title in search results. It should be compelling, include key event details, and encourage users to take action.\n\nExample: \"Join us for the annual Austin Food Festival! Enjoy amazing local eats, live music, and family-friendly fun. Get your tickets now!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMain header (H1): The H1 is the main title displayed on the top of your event page. It helps both users and search engines understand what your event is about. It should be clear, descriptive, and include relevant keywords.\n\nExample: \"Austin Food Festival \u2013 A Culinary Experience You Can\u2019t Miss!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlt text for images: Alt text is a short description added to images for accessibility and SEO. It helps search engines understand the content of your images and improves visibility in image search results.\n\nExample: \"Crowd enjoying delicious food at Austin Food Festival 2025\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent description: This is the detailed information about your event that appears on your website and listings. It should include the event\u2019s name, date, location, key highlights, and a call to action.\n\nExample: \"Experience the flavors of Austin at the 2025 Austin Food Festival. Featuring the city\u2019s top chefs, local vendors, and live entertainment, this is the must-attend event of the season. Located at Zilker Park, the festival runs from June 15-17. Secure your tickets today!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can building local citations and backlinks improve event SEO?\n\n\n\nLocal citations are when other websites mention your event in their content, while backlinks are when these outside sources link off to your event website. Both of these improve search rankings and boost your reputation. They\u2019re super important because they build social proof and drive traffic to your website. Curious how you can get them? Here are a few quick tips!\n\n\n\n\nReach out to local bloggers, influencers, and news sites to cover your event. You can send press releases to local media outlets about your event. Or even offer influencers and bloggers free event access in exchange for coverage.\n\n\n\nPartner with local businesses for cross-promotion and sponsorship mentions. Ask nearby restaurants, hotels, or stores to share your event on their websites or social media and offer to promote their business in return (e.g., include their name on event signage or offer event discounts for their customers).\n\n\n\nGet listed on tourism and city event calendars by reaching out to local tourism boards and city websites. Many cities have online event submission forms, so take advantage of these free promotional opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nHow does social media impact local search visibility for events?\n\n\n\nSocial media isn\u2019t just for engagement anymore \u2014 it\u2019s becoming a major search engine! Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook are changing the way people find events, with users increasingly searching for things to do directly within these apps. This means that optimizing your social media presence can significantly impact your event\u2019s local search visibility. Here\u2019s how to optimize it:\n\n\n\n\nCreate engaging event pages on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Regularly update with teaser content, behind-the-scenes footage, and countdowns.\n\n\n\nUse location-based hashtags and geotags to increase local reach. Add hashtags like #AustinFoodFestival or #ConcertsInLA to reach local searchers.\n\n\n\nEngage with local communities and influencers to spread the word. Share your event in local Facebook groups or Reddit threads or partner with micro-influencers who have engaged local followings.\n\n\n\n\nWhy is user-generated content and reviews important for event SEO?\n\n\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) is any content \u2014 photos, videos, testimonials \u2014 created by attendees rather than your brand. UGC is powerful because it builds trust and authenticity. Potential attendees often rely on reviews and social proof before deciding whether to buy tickets. Here\u2019s how to encourage them:\n\n\n\n\nAsk attendees to leave reviews on Google, Facebook, and Yelp. Send post-event emails thanking attendees and linking directly to review pages or even offer incentives (e.g., entry into a giveaway) for leaving honest feedback.\n\n\n\nEncourage social shares by creating branded hashtags and running contests. Develop a unique event hashtag and promote it on all materials. Run a contest where attendees post photos taken in a photo booth at your event with your hashtag for a chance to win a prize.\n\n\n\nFeature user-generated content on your event pages and social media. You can even create a \u201cWhat People Are Saying\u201d section on your event page!\n\n\n\n\nWhat tools can you use to track and improve local SEO for events?\n\n\n\nTracking your event\u2019s local SEO performance isn\u2019t just something you do at the end \u2014 it\u2019s an ongoing process that helps you refine your strategy and make necessary adjustments along the way. Ideally, you should check your performance weekly leading up to the event to see if your pages and listings are gaining traction. Daily monitoring may be helpful in the final days before the event to maximize visibility. After the event, reviewing performance data helps you understand what worked well and what needs improvement for future events. Useful local SEO tools include:\n\n\n\n1. Google Search Console\n\n\n\nUse Google Search Console to track the performance of how your website or landing page ranks in search results for location-based queries. It can also help you detect any issues with your pages. For instance, if your event is in a specific city, you can monitor how well your page ranks for keywords like \u201cevents in Dallas\u201d and identify if there are issues with indexing or mobile performance that need addressing.\n\n\n\n2. Google Analytics\n\n\n\nThis platform helps you monitor where your traffic is coming from. You can use Google Analytics to see audience insights like how many visitors are from the event\u2019s location, how they found your site, and what pages they interact with the most. This helps refine targeting and conversion strategies.\n\n\n\n3. Google Business Insights\n\n\n\nBy setting up a Google Business Profile for your event, you can track how users are finding your event, whether through direct searches (e.g., your event name) or discovery searches (e.g., searching for terms like \u201cevents near me\u201d). Google Business Insights also shows actions people take on your profile, such as calling or requesting directions, helping you optimize for local visibility.\n\n\n\n4. Analytics on your social media accounts\n\n\n\nMonitoring engagement on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook helps track which hashtags and content resonate with your local audience. For example, if you use a hashtag like #CharlotteEvents, you can track how much engagement this gets from users in that city and refine your content strategy to include more relevant, local-specific topics or promotions.\n\n\n\nConducting a local SEO audit\n\n\n\nA local SEO audit can help assess the effectiveness of your optimization efforts. By evaluating the key metrics for local SEO success, like organic traffic, engagement, and local search rankings, you can identify areas for improvement and ensure your event's visibility stays strong. Use this list of questions to easily conduct an audit on the quality of your event\u2019s SEO:\n\n\n\n\nAre your event name, date, time, location, and ticket information consistent across all platforms (website, event listing sites, Google Business Profile, social media, etc.)?\n\n\n\nAre you using local and event-specific keywords? For example, \u201cNashville music events,\u201d \u201cconcerts near me,\u201d or \u201cupcoming rock concerts in Nashville\u201d.\n\n\n\nIs your Google Business Profile (GBP) set up and fully optimized with the correct event details? Are you posting regular updates to this profile about ticket sales, new speakers, event news, etc.?\n\n\n\nIs your event website mobile-friendly? Does it load quickly and display correctly on mobile devices?\n\n\n\nAre you listed in local event directories (e.g., Songkick for concerts and local tourism boards) and receiving backlinks from local blogs, businesses, or news outlets?\n\n\n\nAre you using location-based hashtags and geotags on your social media posts? Are you interacting with local influencers and event-goers?\n\n\n\nAre people leaving reviews about your event on Google, Facebook, or Yelp? Are you encouraging attendees to post photos, videos, and testimonials?\n\n\n\nAre you tracking how your event is performing in local searches? Tools like Google Search Console and Google Analytics can show you search rankings, traffic sources, and user behavior.\n\n\n\nHave you implemented event schema markup on your event webpage? This structured data helps search engines understand your event\u2019s details better.\n\n\n\n\nMake local SEO work for your event\n\n\n\nLocal SEO is a super affordable and effective way to attract more attendees, boost ticket sales, and ensure your event gets the attention it deserves. By optimizing your Google Business Profile, website, event listings, and social media presence, you can increase your event\u2019s visibility and maximize attendance!

Unfortunately, this could also make you a target for cybercriminals. Whenever emails, personal data, and financial information are involved (like having online accounts or selling tickets to your events), phishing attacks are a potential danger to be aware of. But don\u2019t worry! Our team is here to equip you with practical tips to protect yourself, your team, and your attendees from phishing attacks.\n\n\n\nWhat is phishing?\n\n\n\nPhishing is a type of cybercrime in which scammers attempt to trick users into sharing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. They'll pretend to be someone trustworthy, like a well-known brand or even your event itself, and ask people to complete an action (e.g., clicking a link, verify your account information) that ultimately leaks sensitive data to them.\n\n\n\nPhishing attacks happen through various methods, like sending emails, phone calls, texts, and social media messages. When it comes to events, a scammer may pretend to be your ticketing provider, ask you to reenter your password, and get you to click a link with malicious code. They may even pose as your event to try to sell fake event tickets to people. Recognizing these tactics is key to staying protected!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should event organizers be aware of phishing?\n\n\n\nIf you're an event organizer, it\u2019s essential that you educate yourself on how to avoid phishing attacks. This is because you're handling sensitive data like names, emails, financial details, or even addresses as you make money from revenue streams like ticket sales, donations, and merch. Luckily, if you're with a secure ticketing solution like TicketLeap, that data is safe with us!\n\n\n\nHowever, you still have to be on the look out for bad actors pretending to be your ticketing platform in an attempt to gain access to your account's login information and exploit the data once they're inside. If you're not careful, phishing attacks can interrupt your ticket sales, compromise people's personal or financial information, hurt your reputation, or even lead to identity theft. Educating yourself, your team, and your attendees about phishing is critical to ensuring everyone stays safe!\n\n\n\nWhat types of phishing should ticket buyers look out for?\n\n\n\nIf you're an attendee, be on the look out for phishing schemes like a fake email masquerading as an event you're planning to attend or wanting to buy tickets to. The more well-known the event, the more likely phishing attempts like ticket scams are possible. As a general rule, always purchase from the event's official website and communicate with their team directly.\n\n\n\nHow to identify phishing attacks\n\n\n\nCatch phishing scams before they catch you! Here are the red flags of suspicious emails to watch out for.\n\n\n\n1. Incorrect sender email address\n\n\n\nAlways double check the \u201cFrom\u201d address and \u201cReply-To\u201d fields in an email. Phishing emails might use a fake reply address that doesn't match the original sender's \u201cFrom\u201d email address. If these don\u2019t match, that\u2019s a sign the email is likely illegitimate. Scammers will often also create addresses that look legitimate but contain subtle variations, like using extra punctuation, hyphens, or misspelled domain names. For example, they may replace an \u201co\u201d with \u201c0\u201d or use \u201cr\u201d and \u201cn\u201d instead of a \u201cm\u201d.\n\n\n\nAs we mention in this help article, if you ever get an email from TicketLeap, the email will always be from @ticketleap.com, @ticketleap.events, or @leapevent.tech. Any other email alterations (e.g., ticketleap@gmail.com or info@ticket-leap.com) are from scammers. When in doubt, reach out to our team at contactus@ticketleap.com!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Suspicious links or attachments\n\n\n\nHover your mouse over any links in emails to see where they\u2019ll actually take you before clicking. When in doubt, don't click it! Phishing links may look like they lead to a trusted site but instead direct you to a fake webpage designed to steal your credentials. Likewise, avoid downloading unexpected attachments or engaging with unexpected pop ups \u2014 they could contain malware!\n\n\n\n3. Urgent language\n\n\n\nBe wary of emails that pressure you with urgency to take some immediate action on your account, like \u201cYour account has been locked! Act now to restore it.\u201d When an email asks you to take unexpected actions like reentering your password or verifying your account details, think before you click! While a legitimate company may send these kinds of emails to help you secure your account, make sure you double check the sender\u2019s email (e.g., @ticketleap.com) and the links before moving forward. When you get messages like this, it's a good idea to verify this email through official channels (e.g., by contacting the company directly using a trusted contact method) before taking any action.\n\n\n\n4. Spelling and grammatical errors\n\n\n\nLook out for emails riddled with awkward phrasing, spelling issues, or grammatical mistakes. Another red flag? The language of the email is rather generic. Reputable organizations take care to ensure their communication is professional and error-free.\n\n\n\nPhishing Email Examples\n\n\n\nFor an event organizer, a fake email may look like this one below. Someone is pretending to be TicketLeap, asking you for a refund, but in reality they want you to click a malicious link. Notice how the link is not even our ticketleap.events link, and when you hover over it, it takes you somewhere completely different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ticket buyers, be cautious of phishing emails that appear to come from the actual event but are actual fake emails designed to steal your personal information. These scams might ask you to \"confirm your payment details,\" click on a link to \"retrieve your tickets,\" or provide login credentials to access your account. Be wary of urgent language, unfamiliar email addresses, or attachments, as these are common red flags in phishing attempts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to protect your business from phishing scams\n\n\n\nWant to know the secret on how to prevent phishing attacks? Stay proactive! Here are six security habits that'll ensure your events stay protected:\n\n\n\n1. Use secure passwords\n\n\n\nShort passwords are a thing of the past! Opt for long, random strings of text (more than 16 characters) with mixed-case letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider pass-phrases like \u201cGiraffeBaristaCoffeeDragon!\u201d with 4-7 unrelated words strung together into a memorable phrase. Make sure you use unique passwords - don't reuse your passwords for multiple accounts! We don't expect you to remember all of them though. Use a password manager like 1Password, Dashlane, or NordPass to store them all so you only have to remember one master password!\n\n\n\n2. Set up two-factor authentication\n\n\n\nTwo-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection to your account, requiring both a password and a time-sensitive verification code sent to an external device via a phone number or authenticator app. This should be set up on all your accounts that provide this option, especially those with access to sensitive business data, such as emails and banking account numbers. This includes your TicketLeap account! As you can learn about in this help article, we offer this feature to ensure your data stays secure with us.\n\n\n\n3. Never provide personal information to unverified sources\n\n\n\nA good rule of thumb: If you did not initiate the conversation, you very likely shouldn't provide them with any sensitive or confidential information. This includes passwords, account numbers, and your social security number. Even if the email looks real, most companies will not ask for this type of information in this way. When in doubt, contact the organization or event organizer themselves to verify if this message is legitimate. You should also log into your online accounts directly through their website rather than clicking the links provided.\n\n\n\n4. Educate your team and attendees\n\n\n\nFor event organizers, make phishing awareness part of your training process when hiring new staff. Additionally, share tips and resources with your attendees (like this blog!) through email or social media to inform them about the danger of phishing attacks. When selling your tickets online, clearly state what the link to your ticketing page is (such as ticketleap.events) and anything else is incorrect. It could also help to have information on your website to clarify that tickets are only valid when purchased directly from your website, and not from a third party.\n\n\n\n5. Keep your computer updated and protected\n\n\n\nInstall anti-virus software to fill any security patches and provide an extra barrier from malicious files. Always make sure this stays updated, and make sure to keep your web browsers up-to-date too! It's also best that you don't save any passwords and other sensitive data (e.g., credit cards, addresses) directly in your browser, but instead store them in your password manager as an extension on your browser.\n\n\n\n6. Report suspicious emails\n\n\n\nThe moment you catch any phishing emails or suspect suspicious activity, report it! Don\u2019t open links or download any attachments. Instead, mark the emails as spam, delete them, and (when possible) alert the company affiliated with that request through another form of communication. For example, if you were to receive any suspicious requests that appear to be from TicketLeap, contact our support team to verify the request or to confirm that it's actually from one of many known phishing sites.\n\n\n\nWhat to do if your account gets compromised\n\n\n\nIf you're a victim of a phishing attack, you'll need to act quickly to restore your accounts. Here are vital steps for you to take:\n\n\n\n\nNotify the company of your compromised account. You need to also notify your IT team if this attack is affiliated with work or school-related accounts.\n\n\n\nUpdate all your passwords on any affected accounts, plus any additional accounts that use the same password.\n\n\n\nSet up two-factor authentication on your accounts if you haven't already.\n\n\n\nRecord as many details as you can about the phishing attack (This will be important for reporting purposes later, especially if law enforcement needs to get involved).\n\n\n\nIf you lost money or face identity theft because of the phishing attack, report it to your local law enforcement and share the details you recorded.\n\n\n\n\nWondering if you've been successfully phished? Here are the signs to look out for:\n\n\n\n\nUnable to log into your accounts\n\n\n\nAbnormal charges to your bank account\n\n\n\nStrange accounts appearing on your monthly statements or credit report\n\n\n\nDenial of your credit card\n\n\n\n\nIf you think your TicketLeap account was compromised, contact TicketLeap\u2019s support team as soon as possible and we\u2019ll work with you to restore your account!\n\n\n\nHow TicketLeap helps you avoid phishing scams\n\n\n\nWhen event organizers use TicketLeap to sell their tickets, they can have peace of mind that they're in safe hands!

Thinking you could use a little help? Enter artificial intelligence \u2014 the new secret weapon for event planners. From generating creative ideas to streamlining logistics, AI tools are making it easier than ever for event organizers to plan successful events without breaking a sweat. In this article, we\u2019ll explore how using AI for event planning can save you time, boost your creativity, and make your process more efficient. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n\n\nBenefits of AI in event planning\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is all about using smart technology to handle tasks that usually are done by humans (like problem solving and decision making). In the event industry, AI can help with everything from managing schedules to giving you fresh ideas.\n\n\n\nFor event organizers, AI is a game changer! It helps save time and cut costs by automating things like ticketing, marketing, and scheduling. In return, this gives you more freedom to focus on the fun and creative aspects of your event. Plus, AI is a great tool for brainstorming and fine-tuning ideas, offering fresh perspectives when you\u2019re stuck. That said, while AI is an incredible helper, it\u2019s your creativity and vision that should always be at the heart of your event planning!\n\n\n\nAI tools for event planning\n\n\n\nAI can be a powerful ally in simplifying many areas of your event planning. Here\u2019s how this technology can assist through different stages of your journey:\n\n\n\nEvent concept and theme development\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to brainstorming creative event concepts, AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper can really come in handy. These tools can generate unique event ideas based on factors like your target audience, season, or budget constraints. For instance, if you\u2019re planning a summer community fair, you can prompt AI to suggest themes that combine outdoor fun and family-friendly activities.\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed down a concept, Canva\u2019s Magic Design can take it a step further by helping you design your visual assets. Whether you need a logo, color palette, or mood board to convey your event\u2019s aesthetic, Canva will generate customizable templates that align with your event theme. This is super useful for organizers looking to maintain a cohesive brand without hiring a professional designer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket sales\n\n\n\nSelling tickets is one of the most crucial parts of event planning, and AI paired with a user-friendly ticketing platform like TicketLeap can make it a whole lot easier. Need help writing a captivating event description or creating speaker bios? Tools like ChatGPT got you covered. You can even quickly generate an FAQ section to add to your event website that answers common questions attendees might have. Plus, using AI-powered SEO tools like SurferSEO ensures your content ranks well on search engines.\n\n\n\nIf you need more event content,(like photos to promote a first-time event), AI photo generators like DALL\u00b7E can create a polished header image that fits your theme perfectly. An AI tool can also help you find that sweet spot for ticket prices by analyzing similar events and market trends, making sure your pricing is competitive and appealing to your audience.\n\n\n\nMarketing and promotion\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to getting the word out, AI can supercharge your marketing efforts. Tools like HubSpot AI and Writesonic are great for crafting catchy social media posts and launching email campaigns that grab your readers\u2019 attention. Whether you\u2019re promoting a community festival or a workshop, these tools can help tailor your messaging to your audience, making your content even more intriguing to them.\n\n\n\nNeed to spread the word even further? AI can also assist in drafting a professional press release to announce your event. Plus, digital ad platforms like Meta Ads use AI tools like Meta Advantage to help you create targeted ad campaigns, ensuring your event reaches the right people and maximizes your event budget.\n\n\n\nAttendee engagement\n\n\n\nWanting to really elevate your experience? Recruit AI tools to better engage with your guests. For instance, tools like Mailchimp\u2019s AI features can personalize attendee communications. You can tailor email campaigns based on guest preferences or behaviors, ensuring every attendee feels valued.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a unique way to engage your attendees?&nbsp; Create and customize interactive games with Rosebud AI for them to play! Level up your experience with a trivia challenge or a themed game tied to your event!\n\n\n\nIf your event needs the perfect soundtrack, AI can help there too! Spotify\u2019s DJ feature can curate playlists based on your event\u2019s theme and audience preferences, setting the right mood from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 practical prompts when using AI for event planning in ChatGPT\n\n\n\nThe secret to getting the best results with AI lies in crafting quality prompts. The more specific you are, the better AI can deliver exactly what you need. Here are a few practical examples to help you get started, plus a few tips for refining your prompts in ChatGPT or other AI chatbots.\n\n\n\n1. Prompt for social media content\n\n\n\nA basic prompt might generate you a generic social media post, but adding more details can transform the output into something truly engaging. Instead of just asking AI for social media captions, make sure to mention relevant keywords you want to include, specify the tone you want (e.g., playful, professional, quirky), and define your target audience. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n\n\n\u201cGenerate 5 Instagram captions for a winter-themed craft fair that includes the keyword \u2018handmade gifts\u2019, uses a playful tone, and targets families with young children.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. Prompt for generating an event email\n\n\n\nWant to send a buzzworthy event email? Give AI clear instructions of what you\u2019re looking for. Be sure to mention your preferred style, the essential details of your event (e.g., date, time, location), and what action you want recipients to take, like in this prompt:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWrite an event invitation email for a summer music festival called \"Sunset Sounds.\" Include a headline, the event date (July 15), location (Oceanview Park, California), and highlights such as live performances, local food trucks, and a beer garden. End with a call to action encouraging early ticket purchases. Use a friendly, conversational tone.\u201d\n\n\n\n3. Prompt for scheduling and logistics\n\n\n\nFor creating detailed timelines or schedules, the more context, the better. Be sure to include all the important details like location, activities, and duration of each session. As needed, you should also mention budget constraints or any special considerations (like noise curfews).\n\n\n\n\u201cCreate a timeline for a one-day music festival in Central Park with three live performances, food trucks, and a craft market. The target audience is young adults, and the event officially starts at 11AM before wrapping up by 10PM. Account for at least two hours of set-up and tear-down time.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. Prompt for event description\n\n\n\nA good event description should be concise yet engaging, highlighting the must-know details and setting the tone for your event. When creating your prompt, include specifics like the event\u2019s purpose, audience, key features, and an action you want readers to take. Try this prompt:\n\n\n\n\u201cWrite a 150-word event description for a fall harvest festival designed for families. Highlight key features like hayrides, pumpkin picking, live music, and local food vendors. Emphasize the festive, family-friendly atmosphere and include a call-to-action encouraging readers to buy tickets early to save their spot.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. Prompt for designing an event logo\n\n\n\nWhen prompting AI for a logo design, be clear about the style, colors, and key elements that represent your event. Providing a brief description of the event\u2019s theme or vibe will also help create a more relevant design:\n\n\n\n\u201cDesign a logo for a charity 5K run called \u2018Run for Hope.\u2019 The event supports local cancer research. Use a minimalist style, shades of blue to symbolize hope, and incorporate a running shoe icon to reflect the event\u2019s focus.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. Prompt for brainstorming event themes\n\n\n\nNeed some creative inspiration for your next event\u2019s theme? To get the most creative and relevant theme ideas, include details about your audience, event type, and desired atmosphere. Get specific with your request:\n\n\n\n\u201cGenerate five theme ideas for a corporate holiday party hosted by a financial firm. The event should balance a formal atmosphere with a fun, engaging twist, appeal to a professional audience, and include elements like festive d\u00e9cor and interactive activities.\u201d\n\n\n\n7. Prompt for writing an event press release\n\n\n\nCrafting a press release? For an effective press release, your prompt should include the event\u2019s purpose, key highlights, quotes from organizers or stakeholders, and any critical information like where to buy tickets or who all is part of your lineup. A clear tone (e.g., professional or enthusiastic) ensures the AI matches your intended style.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u201cWrite a press release announcing the inaugural \u2018Art in the Square\u2019 community festival, a celebration of local artists and performers taking place on September 15 at Central Plaza. Highlight featured artists such as painter Mia Thompson, sculptor Alex Rivera, and musician The Harmony Trio. Include a quote from the organizer, Sarah Lee, stating, \u201cArt in the Square is all about bringing our community together to support and celebrate the incredible talent we have right here in our backyard.\u201d Mention that tickets are $10 for general admission, with early bird pricing of $8 available until August 31. Tickets can be purchased on their website through TicketLeap. Use a professional yet enthusiastic tone to engage readers and generate excitement.\u201d\n\n\n\nLimitations and ethical use of AI\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhile AI is a powerful tool for event planning, it\u2019s essential to remember that it should complement your creativity and not replace it. AI can help streamline tasks and provide ideas, but the heart of your event needs to come from your personal vision! Overrelying on AI can lead to inaccuracies, biases, or generic content, so it\u2019s important to review and refine its outputs to ensure they align with your goals. Plus, you may think of ideas and solutions that AI never would!\n\n\n\nWhen using AI, always be cautious with confidential information. For example, avoid sharing sensitive data like attendee lists or financial details. Ethical use of AI is key, so ensure the content it generates is inclusive, respectful, and accurate. With the right balance, AI can be an invaluable resource, but channeling your creativity makes your event truly unique!\n\n\n\nReady to supercharge your event planning?\u00a0\n\n\n\nAI is a powerful assistant for event organizers, offering many opportunities to simplify tasks, enhance creativity, and boost efficiency. With the right tools, you can focus more on the details while AI handles the outline of your event planning process! Remember, the key is to use AI as a tool to supplement your unique vision.Want to make your event planning even easier?

Roaring twenties\n\n\n\nTake your guests back to the glitz and glamor of the 1920s! Encourage flapper dresses and tuxedos for the attire. Offer a champagne tower to bring in the New Year in style and to serve as a stunning centerpiece as guests arrive. A live jazz band can immerse guests into the era, while a vintage photo booth captures the fun! You can elevate your atmosphere even more by setting up a speakeasy-style cocktail bar with classic 1920s drinks like sidecars and French 75s, giving guests a taste of Prohibition-era indulgence. To add an element of surprise, consider hosting a Charleston dance-off!\n\n\n\nTip: Create tiered ticketing options for this upscale event, including VIP packages with access to additional perks like free cocktails or photo booth tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Stars align&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn astrology and zodiac-themed party is sure to enchant your attendees.

All that glitters is gold&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor a more luxurious New Year\u2019s Eve, host an \u201cAll That Glitters is Gold\u201d party. Start by setting the scene with gold tablecloths, shimmering metallic streamers, and a statement backdrop of large, gold foil balloons that spell out the year. For an interactive touch, create a gold-themed photo booth complete with gold sequin backdrops and oversized golden props like crowns. As for drinks, offer gold-themed cocktails like a sparkling champagne punch with gold sugar-rimmed glasses or martinis topped with edible gold flakes. For the grand finale, plan a dramatic gold balloon release at midnight \u2014 fill the ceiling with balloons ready to cascade down as the clock strikes twelve!\n\n\n\nTip: Your event software can help by sending digital \u201cgolden tickets\u201d to guests, offering exclusive access to premium areas or experiences within your event.\n\n\n\n10. Blossoming beginnings\n\n\n\nCreate a serene atmosphere with this floral theme. Set up a bloom wall where guests can pin their written hopes and dreams for the new year on paper flowers. Consider offering flower crowns as party favors. You can either pre-make them using fresh or faux flowers, or set up a do-it-yourself flower crown station where guests can create their own crowns using a mix of blooms, leaves, and ribbons. As a nice touch, serve floral-infused cocktails or mocktails like lavender lemonade or rosewater spritzers.\n\n\n\nTip: Create a giveaway contest where attendees can post photos with their crowns using your branded hashtag for a chance to win future event tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Wishing upon a new year\n\n\n\nSet up a whimsical wishing well at your event, where guests can toss coins and make a wish for the new year. Be sure to include a setup where guests can grab a coin in case they don\u2019t have one! For an added touch, include a wishing tree, where guests can hang their wishes. Offer metallic pens and paper for guests to add some flair to their wishes.\n\n\n\nTip: With your ticketing software, set up a donation option where attendees can donate to a charity with every wish, combining good deeds with the magic of the night.\n\n\n\n12. New Year kickoff&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnite the sports fans in your community with this theme where the spirit of competition and celebration collide! Encourage guests to wear their favorite team jerseys or dress as iconic athletes from any sport. Think basketball uniforms, football helmets, or even tennis skirts. Set the tone by decorating your space with team flags, pennants, and inflatable sports gear (e.g., soccer balls and footballs) to create a true stadium atmosphere. You could organize a flip-cup tournament on a table covered with a green \u201cfield\u201d tablecloth, marked with yard lines to mimic a football field. For a unique twist, create a marble race track inspired by NASCAR, using long cardboard tubes decorated like a racetrack, where guests can race marbles to the finish line.\n\n\n\nTip: Utilize event reminder emails through your ticketing platform with fun messaging like \u201cGear up for the big day!\u201d to get your attendees excited for the upcoming big kickoff!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Keep swimming into the new year\n\n\n\nInspired by Disney\u2019s Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, this under-the-sea party includes blue lights, jellyfish lanterns, and ocean-inspired food and drinks. Set up a \u201cDeep Dive\u201d memory lane activity where guests can reflect on their favorite moments of the past year. Create a display wall or table with seashell-shaped notecards where attendees can write down their most memorable experiences from the past year too. Attach these cards to fishing nets or pin them onto a large \u201creef\u201d board for everyone to read and reminisce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTip: Link an animated video or looped clip of floating bubbles and shimmering lights to create a mesmerizing underwater effect on your event ticketing landing page!\n\n\n\n14. Red carpet&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoll out the red carpet and let your attendees live out their celebrity dreams! Have a paparazzi photo booth, upscale food and drinks, and a chance for attendees to dress as their favorite stars. As guests arrive, have a \u201cpaparazzi photo booth\u201d waiting for them at the end of the carpet, complete with flashing camera lights, faux photographers, and a branded backdrop featuring your event name and logo! Consider giving out awards for the best dressed or best celebrity resemblance to mimic an award show.\n\n\n\nTip: Allow VIP ticket holders early entry with exclusive access to the \u201cgreen room,\u201d where they can enjoy extra perks like champagne and hors d'oeuvres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Glam and give back gala&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnd the year on a charitable note with a New Year\u2019s Eve fundraising gala! Guests can dress to impress, while live updates on donation goals motivate people to give more to your cause. You can make your event more interactive by setting milestone goals. For example, when you hit a certain donation mark, announce a special activity or surprise like an additional performance, a champagne toast, or a raffle prize. To inspire your attendees, invite a guest speaker who\u2019s either directly involved with the cause you\u2019re supporting or someone with a powerful story that resonates with your event's theme. Be sure to decorate your event with bright metallics and fun New Year photo backdrops to get your guests excited for the new year!\n\n\n\nTip: Utilize your event software\u2019s donation feature to easily track donations so you can encourage higher contributions throughout the night!\n\n\n\nNew Years Eve party decoration ideas\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s explore some fun decor options that will elevate your New Year\u2019s Eve celebration and leave your attendees in awe!\n\n\n\n1. Balloon drop&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInflate balloons and place them in a large net or plastic tablecloth, secured to the ceiling with strong tape, leaving one side untaped for release. Attach a string to the loose side of the net, which will be pulled to release the balloons at the desired moment. Test the drop beforehand to ensure everything goes smoothly, and consider adding confetti or streamers for extra flair! When the clock strikes midnight, simply pull the string to let the balloons cascade down as attendees celebrate.\n\n\n\n2. Light up dance floor&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo build a light-up dance floor, assemble a wooden or acrylic base to serve as the floor's foundation, ensuring it\u2019s sturdy and smooth. Install LED strip lights or fairy lights beneath transparent or frosted acrylic panels, spacing them evenly for uniform lighting. Secure the panels to the base and connect the lights to a power source, preferably with a remote or dimmer for easy control. Add reflective or metallic tape around the edges for extra shine, and test the lights before the event to ensure they\u2019re ready for your dance party.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Disco champagne bowls and glasses\n\n\n\nBegin by purchasing plain champagne bowls or glasses, plus some small mirrored tiles or adhesive mirror mosaic stickers (like those on a disco ball!). Clean and dry the glasses, then apply the mirrored tiles around the base or stem, working your way up as desired, to mimic the look of a disco ball. Ensure the mirrors are evenly spaced and secure, using glue as needed to keep them in place. Let them dry completely, then polish the glasses to remove any smudges, leaving you with dazzling, disco-inspired drinkware perfect for a party.\n\n\n\n4. Champagne tower display\n\n\n\nTo start, place a sturdy tray or platform on a flat surface. Arrange champagne glasses in a square formation, beginning with the largest base layer, ensuring they touch each other. Stack additional layers by placing glasses directly on the gaps between the glasses below, forming a pyramid shape. Typically, four layers work well, but you can adjust based on height preference. Once stacked, carefully pour champagne into the top glass, allowing it to overflow and cascade into the layers below. You can even surround the tower with gold confetti and LED lights to enhance your stunning display!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Countdown balloon garland&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlow up balloons of various sizes and colors, then tie them together using a balloon strip or fishing line.&nbsp; For the countdown, tape large number decals to clear balloons to represent the new year. Layer the balloons, adjusting sizes for depth and texture. Attach the garland to a wall or backdrop using command hooks or tape. For extra flair, add metallic fringe or smaller balloons in between the larger ones to create a full, festive look.\n\n\n\n6. Light displays\n\n\n\nHang twinkling string lights across ceilings, walls, and around entrance ways to transform the space into a magical setting. Use LED candles for a soft, flickering glow without the risk of fire hazards. You can even incorporate lighted marquee numbers or letters that spell out the new year, creating a stunning photo backdrop for your guests.\n\n\n\n7. Confetti cannon\n\n\n\nTo make a large confetti cannon, start with a cardboard tube (like a mailing tube) or PVC pipe, ensuring it's about 2-3 feet long. Fill it with confetti, leaving some space at the top. Use colors that align with your party theme, such as gold for a Gatsby-inspired event or a metallic mix for a fun, sparkly vibe. Seal one end with a cap or tape, and at the other end, create a burst mechanism by using a balloon or tissue paper. To do this, stretch the balloon over the end. When ready to use, pull the balloon to release the confetti with a pop! \u200b\u200bDon\u2019t forget to have a camera ready to capture the moment as the confetti flies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Balloon countdown wall&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArrange balloons in a large display numbered from 10 to 1, corresponding with the countdown to the new year. For each second of the countdown, pop the balloon to get everyone excited. Use a mix of metallic and confetti-filled balloons for a more dramatic effect when they burst, creating a visual pop with each countdown moment.\n\n\n\nTime to welcome in the new year!\n\n\n\nAs the clock strikes midnight and the new year unfolds, the right New Year\u2019s Eve party ideas and decorations can set the stage for a truly unforgettable celebration. Whether you choose a sophisticated gala or a nostalgic throwback, these 15 New Year gathering ideas offer unique ways to engage your guests and create lasting memories.\n\n\n\nReady to bring your vision to life?

On top of being the perfect sweater weather, the season offers endless opportunities to try unique winter party themes that help you celebrate. Whether it\u2019s a formal gathering or something more laid-back, a thoughtful theme will make your event stand out! Here are a few winter-themed party ideas to get your creative juices flowing \u2014 and some super helpful tips along the way of how event ticketing software can streamline the planning process!\n\n\n\n1. Winter wonderland\n\n\n\nTransform your venue into a frosty winter wonderland with snowflake garlands, fake snow, and shimmering icicle string lights. For an added \"wow\" factor, place an ice sculpture as the stunning centerpiece to greet guests as they arrive. To keep everyone warm, set up a hot chocolate bar stocked with marshmallows and an array of flavored syrups. If you're using an event ticketing platform like TicketLeap, you can even include custom questions at checkout, allowing guests to pre-select their favorite hot chocolate toppings and notify your team of any dietary restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Apr\u00e8s ski lodge\n\n\n\nGo for a cozy alpine vibe with faux fur blankets, wooden accents, and string lights. A hot toddy or mulled wine station will keep things warm, while a mini \u201cski slope\u201d photo backdrop adds a fun activity for your attendees. You can even encourage guests to show up in their best ski gear to snap some funny photos with their fellow ski-enthusiast friends! For a seamless experience, offer multiple ticket types, such as general admission and VIP with a complimentary drink included.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Polar Express party\n\n\n\nInspired by the classic holiday movie Polar Express, transform your event space with long tables adorned with lanterns and serve hot cocoa in festive mugs. Keep the cozy vibe going by playing this classic movie in the background to set the perfect mood this holiday season. Invite your guests to come dressed in their favorite holiday pajamas, and consider giving out a sleigh bell to each of them as a party favor at the end. To simplify event planning, consider offering different ticket options for adults and kids, or bundle hot cocoa with the ticket price for a seamless experience once your guests arrive!\n\n\n\n4. Snow globe party\n\n\n\nCreate an intimate, magical setting with a snow globe theme. As far as winter party decoration ideas, clear and white balloons, fairy lights, and white fabric will give your venue the perfect snow globe feel, plus plush chairs and blankets to keep it cozy. The best part? Hand out mini snow globes as party favors so guests have a keepsake, or even have the needed craft supplies ready for your guests to build a snow globe of their own. To make things super simple, use an event ticketing platform to track RSVPs and manage limited seating for this smaller, intimate gathering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Fire and ice\n\n\n\nFor a dramatic, contrasting theme, go with a \u201cFire and Ice\u201d party! Set up separate areas with fire pits for warmth and ice bars for chilling drinks. Serve spicy food on the \u201cfire\u201d side and ice cream or chilled cocktails on the \u201cice\u201d side. You can even add a nostalgic touch to this theme by adding references to the Snow and Heat Miser from the classic film The Year Without a Santa Claus. Don\u2019t forget about entertainment! Fire dancers and ice sculptors can be a great choice for this theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Holiday masquerade ball\n\n\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a bit of mystery? Perfect for an upscale holiday event, a masquerade ball with winter-inspired masks combines a sense of mystery and elegance. Set the scene with chandeliers, glitter, and candlelight, and encourage your attendees to wear formal attire. To add a fun competitive edge, offer prizes for the best masks. For a super polished look, a branded event page could help you set the tone early, allowing guests to see all the event details (like location or dress code) and purchase tickets to your event directly from your page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Arctic adventure\n\n\n\nInvite guests on an Arctic Adventure with decor inspired by polar bears, penguins, and icebergs. Add cotton snow and educational signs about arctic wildlife to make this theme more unique. Incorporating a lively photo booth with arctic animal cutouts will surely make for unforgettable snapshots! Also, make sure to have activities that tie into the theme, such as a \"find the hidden polar bear\" scavenger hunt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Ice palace\n\n\n\nLooking to host a glamorous winter event? Go with an ice palace theme featuring icy blues, crystals, and frosted accents! To get the most out of your decor, dim the lights to create a sparkling ambiance. Consider hosting a contest of your choice that chooses an ice palace king and queen towards the end of the event! To add an elegant touch, ice-themed cocktails or mocktails served in frosted glasses with winter berries will do just the trick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Hot cocoa bar\u00a0\n\n\n\nEmbrace ultimate comfort and warmth with a hot cocoa Bar party! Let your attendees customize their drinks with a delicious array of toppings like whipped cream, peppermint sticks, chocolate chips, and even flavored syrups. To enhance the cozy atmosphere, create inviting seating areas with fuzzy blankets and pillows, ideally around a crackling fireplace or outdoor heaters to keep everyone toasty. You can also offer spiked hot cocoa options for adult guests to add a fun twist to this traditional favorite.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Winter solstice celebration\n\n\n\nCelebrate the longest night of the year with a winter solstice themed party. If you\u2019re in an area where you can use natural elements like evergreens or pine cones, these would be perfect party decorations. Low lighting creates an intimate atmosphere, while mulled cider and a fire pit help honor the return of light! Consider having an activity like writing positive wishes for the new year on small pieces of paper and sticking it in the nooks of a pine cone to be tossed in a fire!&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n11. Christmas movie marathon\n\n\n\nSet up a cozy Christmas movie marathon with plenty of blankets, popcorn, and holiday-themed snacks. For fans of Christmas movies, this may just be the best winter party idea yet! Set up a snack bar where guests can choose from festive treats, like Christmas cracker candy or gingerbread muffins. With a ticketing software like TicketLeap, you can send out a survey beforehand to gauge what movies your attendees love so you can include them in your marathon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Winter carnival\n\n\n\nBring the fun of a carnival into the winter season with games, food trucks or catering, and festive booths. Traditional carnival games like ring toss and balloon darts can be given a wintery twist with snowball throwing or snowman bowling. And what\u2019s a carnival without food? Station food carts around your venue that serve cotton candy, popcorn, or hot pretzels to give your attendees delicious treats to enjoy as they check out your attractions. This winter party theme works really well for large outdoor community events, where multiple ticket options (family passes or individual tickets) can streamline entry to your event!\n\n\n\n13. Cozy cabin\u00a0\n\n\n\nGoing for a rustic and relaxed vibe? Turn your event into a cozy cabin with this winter party theme! Use plaid blankets, wooden accents, and fire pits to create an inviting space. S\u2019mores-making kits and mulled cider are great refreshments that reinforce this relaxed setting. Whether this is a small or large gathering, consider adding some ice breaker activities or small games like an indoor scavenger hunt to engage your guests with each other.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n14. Gingerbread house competition\n\n\n\nTons of cookies and some friendly competition? Yes please! Host a gingerbread house contest where your attendees compete to build the most creative, festive houses. Provide pre-assembled gingerbread kits with candies and icing for decoration. Think about adding categories like \"Most Creative\" or \"Best Structure\" so there can be multiple winners. To help make the competition run smoothly, make managing event registration super easy by setting up different entry types for teams or individuals in your event ticketing system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Winter olympics\n\n\n\nA Winter Olympics theme is perfect for incorporating fun winter sports like ice skating, snowball fights, or sledding. Set up mini competitions with medals or trophies for the winners. You can manage team registrations through your ticketing platform and include questions in your checkout process like t-shirt size for custom jerseys for each team. Be sure to have refreshments to keep your olympians energized and hydrated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n16. Snowman-making contest\n\n\n\nBring out everyone's creativity with a snowman-making contest! If you\u2019re located in an area with natural snow, this is a perfect outdoor event; otherwise, make sure you\u2019re stocked up on artificial snow so guests have all they need! Provide guests with snowman-building materials like scarves, hats, and buttons. Have you ever heard of snow painting? Add some stations with multiple spray bottles mixed with food coloring for a fun addition. To make things easier, use ticketing software to manage entry fees and provide details on what materials will be available or what guests should bring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17. Winter white party\n\n\n\nThis event theme is about embracing an all-white dress code and decor to create a sophisticated, cohesive look and celebrate the winter season. For winter party decoration ideas, think white flowers, crisp linens, and sparkling candles to set the tone for a refined atmosphere. Really want to embrace this theme? Adding a white wine-tasting activity to your event will surely engage your guests! Elevate the experience with white-themed treats like coconut macaroons, vanilla cupcakes, or even a white chocolate fondue fountain for guests to enjoy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n18. Frosted fairy tale\n\n\n\nTransport attendees into a whimsical world with this event theme! Decorate with twinkling lights, faux snow, and woodland creature props. Soft pastel colors like lavender, pale blue, and silver will combine frost and fairies perfectly! Hand out fairy wings or crowns to guests to tie into the theme. Maybe even host a game throughout the duration of your event to see who can find the mini silver magic wand and win prizes or tickets to your next event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Ugly sweater party\n\n\n\nThis casual, fun theme invites guests to wear their tackiest holiday sweaters! Make it competitive by offering prizes for categories like \u201cMost Creative\u201d or \u201cMost Hideous\u201d. To grab some hilarious snapshots, set up a photo booth with goofy props. For extra laughs, you could also host various holiday-themed games, such as having your attendees split into teams and have a limited amount of time to wrap one of their team members in wrapping paper. In addition to voting on the ugliest sweater, have your attendees vote on who did the best gift-wrapping job, then reveal the winners at the end for an extra layer of fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20. Frozen-inspired party\n\n\n\nChannel the popular movie Frozen with icy blues, silvers, and snowflake decor. This theme is perfect for families with little ones. Encourage kids to dress as their favorite characters, and set up a sing-along station with songs from the movie. It\u2019s not a proper party without treats! Consider offering Frozen inspired foods like snowflake decorated cupcakes with Elsa toppers or blue jello with marshmallow Olaf\u2019s! Be sure to add a question during the checkout process about food allergies to make sure your treats are safe for all.\n\n\n\n21. Snowflake ball\n\n\n\nHosting a formal event this winter? Try this snowflake ball theme! Imagine silver and white decor with glittering snowflake accents to set an elegant tone. Use a snow machine to create a magical entrance, give out snowflake-themed party favors, and play live music or hire a DJ for dancing throughout the night. Encourage guests to dress super fancy to truly make your event feel like a ball! Consider selling tickets so your attendees can secure their spot or even reserve a table at your awesome event..\n\n\n\n22. Winter luau\n\n\n\nTired of the cold weather? Give a tropical twist to your event with a winter luau! Decorate with Hawaiian shirts, leis, and tiki torches, but still keep some of the winter vibe with snowy accents or icy cocktails. Serve tropical cocktails like coconut eggnog or pineapple-infused hot toddies. Set up online ticket sales through your event platform to offer early-bird pricing or group discounts for larger parties. If you\u2019re looking for ways to engage your attendees, set up a snow-themed limbo contest, using a frosty bar as the limbo pole. You could also host a \"snowball toss\" into tropical-themed buckets or a ring toss with pineapples or tiki statues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23. Pajama party\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re never too old for a pajama party! Encourage guests to wear their favorite winter pajamas, and create a warm atmosphere by transforming your seating to look like forts! Add tons of cushions and pillows to invite guests to bundle up and relax. Breakfast-for-dinner dishes like pancakes or waffles is a fun play on this theme too. Provide fun games like charades, board games, and karaoke, or even put on your favorite Christmas movie. Hosting a small gathering? Consider hosting a white elephant gift exchange to make your guests feel like it's Christmas morning!\n\n\n\n24. New Year's Eve ice gala\n\n\n\nHost a black-tie New Year\u2019s Eve gala with shimmering ice sculptures, frosted glassware, and cool blue lighting. Want to take it a step further?

Winter beer &amp; wine tasting\n\n\n\nElevate your holiday parties with a sophisticated beer &amp; wine tasting event, showcasing seasonal craft beers and wines.

Hosting events can bring in extra income while showcasing your land\u2019s natural charm. Whether it\u2019s a cozy farm-to-table dinner, a lively harvest festival, or a rustic wedding, there are countless ways to draw in guests and create unforgettable experiences. Let\u2019s explore creative event ideas and smart strategies to help you maximize revenue for your agribusiness!\n\n\n\nWhy events work well on farms, orchards, and vineyards\n\n\n\nEvents on farms, orchards, and vineyards offer something super unique compared to traditional venues. Instead of the usual ballroom or conference room, guests get an authentic experience out in nature \u2013 whether it\u2019s a picnic in the orchard, a wine tasting among the vines, or a hands-on workshop like cheese-making or flower arranging. These types of events create a stronger, more personal connection with both locals and visitors, turning them into advocates who keep coming back for more. By leveraging the natural appeal, you\u2019re offering an experience that stands out and draws people in.\n\n\n\n8 creative event ideas to host on your farm, orchard, or vineyard\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dive into some creative event ideas that\u2019ll be sure to make money on a farm!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Harvest festivals\n\n\n\nHarvest festivals are a fantastic way to celebrate the season and draw people to your farm. Think about hosting fall-themed activities that highlight your crops \u2013 like pumpkin picking, apple cider tasting, or even grape stomping. You can invite local vendors, farmers, and craftspeople to set up booths too. Offer plenty of kid-friendly activities, like hayrides, a petting zoo, or corn mazes, to make it an event for the whole family. The key is to create an atmosphere that's festive and welcoming, so think about using simple fall decorations, like hay bales, pumpkins, or string lights, to enhance the natural beauty of your space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Farm-to-table dinners\n\n\n\nFarm-to-table dinners showcase your produce while partnering with local chefs to create memorable meals. Before dinner, offer guests a guided tour of the property \u2013 people will love to see where their food is grown! When planning the menu, highlight your farm's fresh offerings and consider pairing dishes with local wines or ciders. Promote the event as an exclusive experience, and sell tickets in advance to gauge interest and boost your bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Weddings and private events\n\n\n\nIf you have a picturesque location, consider marketing it as a venue for weddings and private events. Couples are increasingly looking for unique, rustic settings, and your farm, orchard, or vineyard could be just the spot they\u2019re dreaming of. Offer customizable packages that can include ceremony and reception spaces, catering, and even d\u00e9cor options. Don\u2019t forget to think about practical details, like parking and restroom facilities, which can make or break a guest\u2019s experience. Also, reach out to local schools or community organizations that might be interested in renting your space for their events, such as fundraisers or reunions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Workshops and classes\n\n\n\nHosting workshops and classes is a creative way to draw visitors to your farm business and share your expertise! You could offer hands-on activities like cheese-making, fruit preservation, wine tasting, or gardening workshops. Think about inviting local experts or running the workshops yourself, especially if you have a unique skill set. Keep the classes small to ensure a personalized experience, and consider offering a discount for group bookings or repeat attendees to encourage more sign-ups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Outdoor movie nights\n\n\n\nAn open field or vineyard can make a perfect setting for outdoor movie nights. All you need is a large screen, a projector, and some cozy seating options \u2013 think blankets, hay bales, or even vintage chairs. You can add a farm-to-table snack bar featuring your farm's produce, like fresh popcorn, apple cider donuts, or seasonal fruit salads. This type of event is easy to set up and can be a great way to bring in people who might not typically visit a farm or vineyard. Promote it as a family-friendly night out, and consider charging a small admission fee or selling snacks to generate extra income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Wine, cider, and produce tastings\n\n\n\nTasting events are an engaging way to showcase what your farm, orchard, or vineyard has to offer. Set up tasting stations for your wines, ciders, or fresh produce, and consider pairing sessions with local cheeses, breads, or charcuterie to enhance the experience. Make the event interactive by sharing the story behind each product, and offer guests the chance to purchase their favorites onsite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. U-pick events\n\n\n\nU-pick events can be a fun pop-up event to bring people to your property during peak harvest seasons. Let visitors pick their own fruits, vegetables, or grapes, and consider adding educational elements like farm tours or demonstrations on sustainable organic farming practices. This not only provides a great family outing but also helps people connect with where their food comes from. To make it easy, provide baskets or bags for picking, and consider offering a small discount for those who pick above a certain amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Farm stays, glamping, and vineyard retreats\n\n\n\nIf you have the space, consider offering overnight farm stays, glamping, or vineyard retreats. People love unique opportunities to get away, and a rural setting offers a chance to unwind and connect with nature. Include activities like farm tours, animal feeding, or wine tasting under the stars to create a memorable experience. Mark off a dedicated area for people to purchase space to pitch their tents or to park their RV. It\u2019s important that you have at least one or more locations with restrooms and showers too (you can rent a portable version if you don\u2019t have a building). You could also set up a few cozy tents yourself or, if you have the additional budget, invest in refurbishing an old barn into guest rooms. Partner with local businesses to offer additional services like yoga classes or guided nature walks to enhance the stay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 extra ways to maximize revenue beyond ticket sales\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered how online event ticket sales offer a fantastic opportunity to boost your income, but let's explore a few other ways to maximize the agritourism in your area!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Merchandise\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to selling merchandise, consider offering branded products that capture the spirit of your farm \u2013 items like honey, jams, or wine. Event-specific merchandise, such as mugs, T-shirts, or tote bags, can also be a hit with guests who want a memento. To maximize visibility, place a small merch stand near the entrance or main event area, where attendees are likely to browse and buy.\n\n\n\n2. Food and drink\n\n\n\nSet up food stands or carts with delicious offerings made from your farm-grown ingredients or orchard fruits (e.g., fresh apple cider, grilled veggies, or homemade jams). Why not add a \u201cfarm-to-glass\u201d bar featuring farm products like your wines, ciders, or local craft beverages? The key is to offer items they can\u2019t get anywhere else, like a signature cocktail that showcases your farm\u2019s produce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Photography packages\n\n\n\nHire a professional photographer to capture candid moments and sell photo packages to attendees, giving them a treasured memory to take home. Or, instead of hiring a photographer, charge a \"photography fee\" that lets guests bring their own photographer to use your scenic spots. Establish a few picturesque areas around your property, such as a rustic barn or vineyard row, to encourage photo-taking.\n\n\n\n4. Vendor partnerships\n\n\n\nTeaming up with local markets or vendors can create a win-win situation. By inviting local artisans and businesses to sell their products at your event, you not only add variety for your guests but also create an opportunity for additional revenue through vendor fees or profit-sharing. Select food trucks, caterers, or specialty vendors that align perfectly with your event's mission and target market. Plus, cross-promotions with these partners can help attract a broader audience to your farm.\n\n\n\n5. Raffles and auctions\n\n\n\nRaffles and auctions are an extra fun way to engage your audience and raise extra funds! To spark interest, offer farm-related prizes (like baskets of fresh produce, private tours, or exclusive wine tastings) to the winners of your giveaway. Consider partnering with your sponsors or other local businesses for additional prizes as well. Set up a table where attendees can purchase tickets or place bids throughout the event, then announce the winners near the end to end your event on a super high note!\n\n\n\n6. Bonfire rentals\n\n\n\nWhen the weather cools down, bonfire rentals can add a cozy, memorable touch to your events. Set up designated bonfire spots, and rent them out to groups looking to enjoy a relaxing evening under the stars. Enhance the experience by offering s'mores kits, blankets, or hot drinks as add-ons. Make sure the setup includes comfortable seating, ambient lighting, and clear safety measures to ensure everyone feels comfortable and safe. Promoting these bonfire rentals as a unique, intimate way to conclude the day can make your venue a standout choice for visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing your farm, orchard, or vineyard events\n\n\n\nLooking to spread the word about your event? Try out these tactics to market your farm event!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeverage social media\n\n\n\nSocial media is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal for marketing events on your farm, orchard, or vineyard. Share behind-the-scenes content and teasers leading up to the event. For example, think about posting photos or videos of your preparations, like setting up decorations or harvesting produce. This builds anticipation and gives your audience a sneak peek of what to expect. Use hashtags and geo-tags to help your posts reach a wider audience and get your event trending locally. Consider running seasonal giveaways or offering exclusive discounts and limited-time merchandise around holidays to create additional buzz.\n\n\n\nPartner with local businesses\n\n\n\nCollaborating with local businesses can boost your bottom line and attract more attendees at the same time! Work on cross-promotions like offering discount codes for customers of both businesses or running joint advertising campaigns. Make sure to feature these local vendors and sponsors prominently in your marketing materials. After all, a little extra visibility goes a long way in building strong partnerships! For example, a local bakery could offer a free treat to anyone who shows proof of ticket purchase, and in return, you could promote their business at your event.\n\n\n\nEmail marketing\n\n\n\nBuilding an email list can be one of your most effective marketing strategies. Start collecting emails from past attendees, local supporters, and anyone who expresses interest in your events. Use this list to send out invitations, early bird offers, and reminders as the event date approaches. Make your emails feel personal by sharing stories, highlighting unique aspects of the event, or including exclusive discounts for subscribers. Remember, people are more likely to attend if they feel like they\u2019re getting something special just for them!\n\n\n\nLeverage online ticketing tools\n\n\n\nMake it as easy as possible for people to buy tickets by leveraging an online ticketing platform with features perfect for farms! Build a perfectly branded ticketing page with all your event details,&nbsp; and include the link to it on all of your marketing materials. With an event ticketing platform like TicketLeap, our user-friendly interface also automatically generates a QR code for you to add to your flyers! Consider offering group discounts or bundled packages to encourage larger purchases \u2013 for instance, a \u201cfamily pack\u201d or a \u201cfriends' night out\u201d bundle. Mention these deals prominently in your promotions to incentivize people to act quickly and buy more tickets at once. The easier your purchase process is and the more enticing your incentives are, the better your ticket sales will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart planning your next farm event today!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe hope we\u2019ve got your mind full of event ideas to try for your farm!

The other half? Making sure your haunt earns you more than enough money to do this year after year! That's where setting up multiple revenue streams comes in. Not only can additional income sources boost your profits, but they can also enhance the overall experience for your thrill-seeking visitors. Let's explore some ghoulishly good ways to increase revenue for haunts!\n\n\n\n1. Merchandise sales\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love a good souvenir? Merchandise sales are a fantastic way to let your visitors take a piece of the horror home with them.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Consider offering themed T-shirts and hoodies that capture the spirit of your haunted attraction. Hats and beanies with your haunt logo can be popular items, especially during cooler evenings in the fall. Don't forget about smaller souvenirs like keychains, mugs, and posters that can appeal to a wide range of budgets.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: To make the most of merchandise sales, focus on designing unique, spooky items that align closely with your haunt's theme. Once you\u2019ve got your merchandise designed and ready to sell, set up your merchandise booth in a high-traffic area, such as near the exit, to catch visitors as they leave your terrifying experience with adrenaline still pumping. Consider offering bundled tickets that include merchandise, and add a merch store to your website to keep the sales coming after your event too!Potential challenge + solution: Upfront costs for inventory can be steep, so start small with a few popular items and use pre-orders to gauge interest before making larger investments on merch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Themed concessions\n\n\n\nNothing works up an appetite like being scared out of your wits! Offering themed food and drinks can add to your guests\u2019 experience while putting more money in your pocket.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Get creative with spooky-themed food items like \"Witches' Brew\" drinks and \"Monster Burgers\". Halloween-themed snacks such as candied apples and popcorn are always popular too! For an extra touch, create uniquely branded food items that fit your haunt's unique theme.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Consider partnering with local food vendors or setting up your own food booths to offer these treats. Create themed menu items that are not only visually appealing but also tasty. To boost sales, offer package deals that include a meal and a ticket discount, encouraging visitors to dine at your haunt.Potential challenge + solution: Managing food safety and health regulations can be complicated, but they\u2019re super important! Make sure to research what training is needed in your state to properly handle food yourself, or partner with established food vendors who already have the necessary permits and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. VIP experiences\n\n\n\nFor those visitors who want an extra-special fright night, VIP experiences can be a profitable addition to your haunt!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Fast passes for skipping lines can be a hot commodity on busy nights, especially the closer you get to Halloween! For an even more exclusive experience, consider offering private scare zones that give thrill-seekers their own personal nightmare.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Develop tiered ticketing options with added perks to cater to different levels of VIP experiences. For example, you could offer a silver tier that includes a fast pass to skip lines, a gold tier that adds access to exclusive merch, and a platinum tier that includes all of the above plus a private tour of the haunt with a meet-and-greet with the actors. Pro tip: limiting the availability of these experiences helps create a sense of urgency and exclusivity for those who buy them.Potential challenge + solution: Regular guests might feel left out or wish they got VIP passes once they arrive, so offer a limited number of VIP upgrades onsite each night to give everyone a chance to enjoy your more premium experiences. And be sure to highlight the value of your VIP experience so guests know what they're paying for!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Photo opportunities\n\n\n\nCapture the screams, hilarious facial expressions, and memorable moments from inside your haunt with photo ops that your visitors will want to buy and take home with them!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Set up professional photo booths with spooky backdrops that fit your haunt's theme. For an interactive twist, create photo opportunities with live actors that can truly capture the terror of the moment.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Consider hiring professional photographers or using automated photo booths for efficiency. Put effort into creating visually striking and interactive photo backdrops that will make for shareable, memorable images. For those candid moments, set up cameras throughout your haunt that are set to snap after your scare trigger! Offer both digital downloads and printed photo packages for sale to cater to different preferences.Potential challenge + solution: Popular photo spots may end up having a line up people waiting, so use a timed ticketing system for photos or create multiple photo spots to disperse the crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Experience upgrades\n\n\n\nGive your visitors the option to level up their fear factor with additional spooky experiences!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Mini escape room add-ons with themed challenges can provide an extra thrill. As another idea, try offering interactive game zones with prizes to keep visitors engaged between scares. For the ultimate adrenaline junkies, offer scare triggers and jump scare activations they can control.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: When designing escape rooms, ensure the puzzles and challenges fit your haunt's theme seamlessly. Set time limits to keep people moving through so everyone can enjoy the experience. For scare triggers, it could be a button or lever that attendees pull to activate a hidden air cannon, loud noise, or sudden movement of a nearby prop, like a monster springing out or a skeleton dropping from the ceiling. Promote these as separate or add-on experiences to your regular tickets, emphasizing how these upgrades will bring an extra level of fun to their experience.Potential challenge + solutions: Handling added experiences can require a lot more event logistics, so be sure to plan ahead and train your staff thoroughly. Create clear signage to guide visitors through the upgraded experiences smoothly and ensure maximum safety at your haunt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Special nights\n\n\n\nKeep your crowd coming back for more with themed nights and special events.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Host costume contests and themed parties like Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller or zombie apocalypse. Offer lights-on walkthroughs of your attraction for your curious but cautious guests. Consider no scare or family-friendly nights with toned-down scares to attract a wider audience. For the brave, try blackout nights with minimal lighting (glow sticks only) or touch scare nights for a more intense experience.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Schedule these events on off-peak nights (like mid-week in the fall) to boost attendance during slower periods. For more thrilling experiences on these nights, incentivize guests to participate in costume contests by offering cool prizes, like your haunts merch, for the best costumes. To promote these special events, leverage social media, local community groups, and email marketing.Potential challenge + solution: Since these themed nights may bring different crowds with different expectations from their experience, clearly advertise the nature of each special night so visitors know what to expect and can choose the experience that suits them best. This especially goes for visitors who want to ensure they\u2019re going to get too scared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Sponsorship and partnerships\n\n\n\nDon't overlook the potential of partnering with other businesses to boost your revenue!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Offer ad space on your tickets to local businesses, and set up at-event sponsor signage throughout your haunt. You could also sell banner ads on your website, spotlights on your newsletter emails, and shoutouts on your social media. For a more immersive approach, incorporate sponsors into your set design in creative ways like adding an interactive element with branded props or a specific room provided by your sponsor.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Identify potential sponsors that align well with your haunt's audience and theme, like your local escape room, ax-throwing venue, or costume store. Showcase a range of branding opportunities and exclusive promotions on your website for sponsors to choose from. Look for ways to leverage these partnerships for mutual marketing benefits, expanding your reach while providing value to your sponsors.Potential challenge + solution: Acquiring sponsorships can be difficult sometimes, so ensure that you build a compelling sponsorship package that highlights the return on investment your sponsors will receive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Workshops and behind-the-scenes tours\n\n\n\nGive curious visitors a peek behind the curtain of how you make your haunted experiences a reality!\n\n\n\nIdeas: Teach aspiring haunters the art of makeup and special effects through hands-on workshops. Take visitors behind the scenes to uncover the magic that brings your haunt to life. For those passionate about the craft, host educational sessions on haunt creation and design, offering insider knowledge and inspiration for their own haunts.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Schedule these workshops and tours during non-operating hours to avoid conflicting with the main attraction. Bring in experts or use your skilled staff to conduct engaging sessions. Promote these as educational experiences for haunt enthusiasts, emphasizing the exclusive nature of the insider knowledge being shared.Potential challenge + solution: You\u2019ll want to ensure there\u2019s enough interest to ensure you\u2019ll have great attendance to your more niche workshops, so launch a survey to gauge interest in different topics before committing to your sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Midway entertainment\n\n\n\nKeep visitors engaged before and after the main attraction, while maximizing your revenue streams as you do so.\n\n\n\nIdeas: Set up a bar with themed drinks to create the perfect mood and enhance the energy with live music performances. You may even invite fire-handling performers or other awesome entertainers! Add to the excitement with interactive midway games and attractions (e.g., bobbing for apples, pumpkin smash, creepy claw machine) that seamlessly align with your haunt's theme.\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Build a lineup of local musicians and entertainment acts to bring in fresh talent each week, encouraging attendees to come back to your haunt again and again. Make sure to optimize the layout of your attraction with clear signage to naturally guide guests through your different experiences. Build the hype by using social media to promote these additional attractions.Potential challenge + solution: Finding and booking the right entertainment may require some sleuthing. Get connected with your local music scene through Facebook groups and reach out to local venues to discover how to book their acts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Off-season events\n\n\n\nWho says the scares have to stop when Halloween is over? Host haunted events throughout the year to keep the party going!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIdeas: Create haunted events around other holidays throughout the year! Once Halloween ends and people gear up for Christmas, host \u201cKrampus\u201d or \u201cMerry Frightmas\u201d events for a twisted holiday experience. Then, in February, celebrate \u201cValloween\u201d or \u201cMy Bloody Valentine\u201d for a terrifying twist on romance. You could even create \u201cSt. Patrick's Slay\u201d or \u201cSt. Paddy's Nightmare\u201d events in March. Once May rolls around, mark the \u201cHalfway to Halloween\u201d milestone with some extra fun haunts. Don\u2019t forget to capitalize on Friday the 13th with special haunt nights whenever they occur!\n\n\n\nExecution tips: Decorate with festive yet spooky elements to fit each season\u2019s unique theme. Offer specially themed experiences and packages for each event. Market these as unique attractions during the off-season, appealing to thrill-seekers looking for some fun frights year-round!Potential challenge + solution: Since it can be challenging to maintain staff for year-round events, we recommend partnering with local theater groups or hiring seasonal workers for these special events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for frightful financial gains&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere you have it! You\u2019ve got ten new ways on how to make money beyond ticket sales for a haunted attraction! Why not give it a shot?

Elevate your attendees' experience with upgraded seating options closer to the stage or in luxury areas. Take it a step further with upsells to their tickets for premium parking, food and drink packages, or exclusive merchandise.\n\n\n\n3. Sponsorships\n\n\n\nEvent sponsors are essential for boosting your revenue! Attracting sponsors begins with creating compelling, high-value sponsorship packages that showcase the benefits of partnering with your event. You could sell ad space on your website or social media, sponsored sessions, and other prime opportunities for brand visibility to make these packages irresistible. Whether it's naming rights for stages, branded photo booths, or exclusive lounges with phone charging stations and private restrooms, you can provide valuable exposure to your sponsors and share their brands with your attendees in memorable ways!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Vendors\n\n\n\nCreating opportunities for vendors, especially small businesses and artists, can help open doors for them and bring in additional profit for you! Adding a vendor alley can connect your attendees with organizations and creators that align with their interests. Whether it's artists, collectibles dealers, or local food trucks, vendors will eagerly purchase booth space at a high-traffic event filled with engaged potential customers. Another option is to work out a deal with your vendors to earn a percentage of their profits in exchange for setting up at your event. Ensure they're a perfect fit by requiring vendors to submit an application through your registration software before securing their spot. It's a win-win: increased revenue for you and exciting discoveries for your attendees!\n\n\n\n5. Merchandise\n\n\n\nBoost your sales by turning your attendees into brand ambassadors with exclusive event-branded merchandise like t-shirts, lanyards, and hats! Offer these items to help attendees remember your event while spreading your brand name to their friends and family. Boost your pre-show revenue by adding merchandise upsells to your online ticket checkout, providing convenience for your customers when they\u2019re most engaged. For VIPs, consider offering exclusive merch to further enrich their experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Concessions\n\n\n\nWhether you're hosting a music festival, sports game, or community fair, offering a variety of concessions can significantly boost your earnings. Fan-favorites like hot dogs, popcorn, and soft drinks for sporting events or artisanal snacks and craft beverages at a local fair can elevate your event and open up a new revenue channel. Make sure to have proper signage to attract attendees' attention and encourage your staff to invite guests to check out what's on sale. Set up your concession stands in high-traffic areas for the best chance at driving sales. With the right setup, this could become a popular stop for attendees that'll generate additional revenue for your event!\n\n\n\n7. Donations\n\n\n\nCollecting donations is an easy way to generate extra revenue for your events, especially for nonprofits and fundraisers! You can easily request donations through your ticketing page on platforms like TicketLeap, providing a seamless experience for attendees who wish to contribute. For hosting charity events specifically, try hosting a silent auction where guests can bid on intriguing items and super fun experiences. With these strategies, you can maximize your event's impact while supporting a great cause!\n\n\n\n8. Virtual events &amp; live streams\n\n\n\nCreate a virtual component to your events to expand your reach and boost ticket sales! Sell tickets to an exclusive livestream of your event, allowing those who can't attend in person to still participate and enjoy the experience. Ensure you have the right equipment (e.g., camera, microphone, tripod) and a streaming platform that can grant restricted access to facilitate a seamless virtual ticketed experience. Additionally, consider hosting completely virtual events, such as webinars or online classes, to create new revenue streams and connect with your audience in innovative ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Advertising\n\n\n\nCapitalize on advertising space at your event! Offer display ad placements in your email newsletters, paid posts on Facebook and Instagram, space in banners or programs, and even display ads on your event website. Having an engaged audience of event attendees presents a fantastic opportunity for advertisers to gain positive brand awareness and secure new customers, making your event an irresistible partner for brands!\n\n\n\n10. Post-event monetization\n\n\n\nMaximize your event's offering to drive additional revenue long after the event ends! Offer exclusive discounts on tickets to your next event, encouraging attendees to secure their spot early. Sell recordings of key performances, sessions, or workshops to those who want to relive the experience again or revisit valuable content. Additionally, package and sell resources such as presentation slides, e-books, or merchandise from your event. You can even create a membership program granting access to ongoing content and special offers. Not only will you boost your revenue but you'll keep your audience engaged and excited for future events!\n\n\n\nTips to maximize your event revenue\n\n\n\nWith a few strategic moves like these in your toolbox, you can confidently put on a successful and profitable event!\n\n\n\nDefine your target audience\n\n\n\nBy researching the types of people who will enjoy your event the most, you can efficiently target the specific demographics of those most likely to buy tickets. Consider key factors such as location (focus on those near your venue!), interests, and typical age range to ensure you're reaching the right crowd. This targeted approach helps you maximize the time and resources spent on your event marketing, allowing you to connect with attendees who are genuinely interested in your event. By understanding and engaging with your ideal audience, you set the stage for a successful, well-attended event that drives significant revenue!\n\n\n\nLeverage all your marketing channels\n\n\n\nBuild out a comprehensive strategy that taps into all your available marketing channels, mapping out a timeline to build momentum leading up to your event. Begin by building dynamic email campaigns with engaging subject lines and enticing promotions. Utilize in-person tactics such as flyers and word-of-mouth to generate local buzz. Be sure to ask your sponsors to help spread the word too!\n\n\n\nDive into both organic and paid social media on platforms like Facebook and TikTok, consistently update and promote your event on your website, and list it on local event directories to improve search result visibility. Collaborate with influencers to extend your reach, and write compelling press releases for media publicity. Don\u2019t forget to utilize TicketLeap's built-in marketing features, like our email campaign tool, to streamline your marketing efforts!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart marketing your events EARLY\n\n\n\nOnce you've got the essential details of your event squared away (like booking your venue), you'll want to launch your ticket sales and begin to market your event as soon as possible! Ideally, kick off your marketing efforts 4-6 months before the event to have enough time to spread the word and build anticipation. Early promotion allows you to reach your audience multiple times, ensuring they\u2019re aware and eager to attend. Once you've started, keep the momentum going by regularly updating your audience with engaging content \u2014 share sneak peeks of what to expect, behind-the-scenes looks, and countdown posts. Utilize email newsletters, social media campaigns, personalized email invitations, and even early bird ticket discounts to drive continuous interest and engagement.\n\n\n\nWatch your budget\n\n\n\nHosting events for profit isn't just about earning as much money as possible; it\u2019s equally important to keep an eye on expenses to protect your profit margin. Building and sticking to a detailed event budget helps you make smart financial decisions. Be mindful of the costs related to your venue, concessions, merchandise, or VIP experiences related to your realistic sales expectations to ensure your turn a profit. Set your ticket prices at a sweet spot \u2014 affordable enough to attract attendees but high enough to cover costs and generate profit according to your estimated attendance numbers.\n\n\n\nAnother quick tip: if an attendee requests a refund and you're hosting more than one event, encourage them to exchange their tickets for a different date instead in order to help you keep your revenue. With an awesome support team like at TicketLeap, you'll also have assistance winning any chargebacks that may happen to keep that money in your pocket too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a compelling ticketing page\n\n\n\nCreating an exciting ticketing page is a surefire way to maximize your event revenue! Using a platform like TicketLeap, you can design event ticketing pages that drive more ticket sales! Start with a captivating event description that engages potential attendees and highlights what makes your event special. Pair this with visuals that match your branding and stunning images or videos that highlight your upcoming event to draw in your audience. Don\u2019t forget to optimize for SEO by incorporating relevant keywords about your event and its location, making it easier for people to find your event online. Embed this ticketing page on your website and utilize the convenient \"Buy Tickets\" button generated by TicketLeap to streamline the purchasing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost awesome experiences!\n\n\n\nWhen your experiences are top-notch, attendees will be buzzing about them long after the event ends! On top of giving your attendees priceless memories, you'll give them opportunities to take epic photos or videos while enjoying your event. Harness the power of user-generated content by encouraging them to post that content on their social media and tag your event. Share their posts on your own page to foster a sense of community and engagement. When people have a fantastic time, they\u2019re more likely to return, and as demand grows, you can leverage higher ticket prices to drive even more revenue.\n\n\n\nNow, you're ready to host a successful and profitable event!\n\n\n\nWith meticulous planning, smart budgeting, and strategic marketing, you can confidently start generating significant revenue from events. TicketLeap offers a full suite of features and rockstar support to optimize every aspect of planning and execution for all kinds of events, whether for small gatherings or large-scale attractions.

We'll walk you through everything from brainstorming and designing your haunt to navigating safety protocols and building hype in your community. Get ready to make your own haunted house a scream-worthy success!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Prepping for your haunted house\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the details of your haunted house, there are a couple areas to consider. Let\u2019s take a look:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnderstanding your haunt-goers\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to creating a haunted house, knowing your audience is key. Start by identifying your target demographic \u2014 are you aiming to scare families with younger children, thrill-seeking teens, or adults looking for a serious fright? Doing a bit of competitor analysis can really help here. Check out what other haunted houses in your area are doing and see what works and what doesn\u2019t. Tailor your scares and themes to match your audience's preferences. For instance, families might appreciate a slightly tamer haunt, while teens and adults might crave intense, heart-pounding scares. By understanding who you're trying to attract, you can design an experience that keeps them coming back for more.\n\n\n\nSetting a budget\n\n\n\nSetting a budget is one of the first and most crucial steps in planning a haunted house. First, determine your initial costs, which will likely include permits, supplies, marketing, staff, and any actors you may hire to give good scares. It\u2019s essential to allocate your funds wisely so you know where to save and where to splurge. For example, investing in high-quality props and costumes can make a big difference, while creating some decorations yourself can help save money. Remember, you\u2019ll need to keep some funds in reserve for unexpected expenses too. By carefully planning your budget, you can ensure you\u2019re making the most of your resources while still delivering a top-notch haunted experience.\n\n\n\nLocation scouting\n\n\n\nFinding the right location for your haunted house can be a game-changer. Look for affordable venues such as barns, community centers, or even your own property if it\u2019s large enough. Consider the distance, pricing, and accessibility to attendees. You want a place that\u2019s easy for people to find and get to. One smart strategy is partnering with venues to split profits or negotiate a percentage of the ticket sales. This can significantly reduce your upfront costs. And don\u2019t forget to ensure that your location is safe and accessible for all guests. A well-chosen venue can set the stage for a hauntingly good time while staying within your budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Designing the haunted experience\n\n\n\nOnce you've got the event planning down, it's time for the super fun part \u2014 designing the haunted experience itself. Let\u2019s talk about creating a spooky layout, setting up eerie decor, and adding those hair-raising special effects that will leave your guests trembling!\n\n\n\nLayout and flow\n\n\n\nPlan the path and key scare zones carefully to ensure a thrilling experience for your guests. Think about how visitors will move through the space and where the best places are to surprise them. Avoid bottlenecks by ensuring there\u2019s enough room for people to move smoothly from one area to the next. Don\u2019t forget to include emergency exits throughout the paths so guests can leave quickly if needed.\n\n\n\nSet design and decor\n\n\n\nCreating an immersive, eerie atmosphere doesn\u2019t have to break the bank! Craft set pieces and props yourself by repurposing household items or finding treasures at thrift stores. With a bit of creativity, you can turn everyday objects into terrifying props. Lighting and sound are crucial in setting the mood \u2014 think dim lights, flickering bulbs, and eerie sounds. Think about how each room contributes to the overall theme and how you can make guests feel like they\u2019ve stepped into another world.\n\n\n\nEerie special effects\n\n\n\nBudget-friendly options like fog machines, strobe lights, and soundscapes can create an intense atmosphere. Utilize technology to your advantage \u2014 there are plenty of apps available for spooky sound effects, and you can even try your hand at animatronics for a personalized touch. Check out YouTube or online forums like Reddit to find tutorials or helpful advice on do-it-yourself special effect options.\n\n\n\nPro tip: Work at or volunteer at a local attraction in the haunted house industry to help you to gain invaluable insights towards starting your own!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Crafting the scares\n\n\n\nNow that your haunted house is coming together, it's time to focus on the heart of the experience: the scares!\n\n\n\nScary-good actor training\n\n\n\nStart by recruiting volunteers, like members of a drama department at a local high school or college. These aspiring actors are often the best candidates with the enthusiasm and skills needed for the job. You can also post job listings on sites like ZipRecruiter or Indeed. Once you have your team, it's essential to train them to deliver consistent and safe scares. Conduct rehearsals to refine their timing and reactions, ensuring they know how to best scare your guests. Remind them to stay in character and maintain energy throughout the event \u2014 consistent performances are key to a truly terrifying experience. Depending on the intensity of your haunt, you\u2019ll need to go over what they\u2019re allowed and prohibited to do with your haunt-goers, so they have a safe yet exhilarating experience.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPetrifying props and costumes\n\n\n\nStart your costume and prop search with affordable items from thrift stores, garage sales, and online marketplaces. For a personal touch, try creating realistic and terrifying effects yourself. For example, use old clothes and paint to create fake blood-stained garments or repurpose household items into eerie props. The more detailed and realistic your props and costumes are, the more convincing your haunted house will be, adding to your overall fright factor!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Enforcing safety guidelines and regulations\n\n\n\nSafety first! Let's break down what you need to do to protect your guests and comply with all necessary regulations.\n\n\n\nSafety protocols\n\n\n\nEnsuring the safety of your guests and staff is paramount. To adequately plan for emergencies, make sure your haunted house has clearly marked exits, a first aid station, and adequate security personnel. Prepare for unexpected weather by having contingency plans, such as covered waiting areas, alternate routes, or a communication strategy for any event cancellation. It's also important to train your actors on your haunt\u2019s rules based on its intensity to suit different comfort levels. This can include how close they are allowed to get to your attendees, if they\u2019re able to touch them in any capacity, and vice versa. By prioritizing safety, you create a secure environment where everyone can enjoy the scares without unnecessary risks.\n\n\n\nLegal considerations\n\n\n\nNavigating the legal aspects on how to make a haunted house is essential yet can seem daunting, but we\u2019re here to help! First, acquire the necessary permits and insurance to protect yourself and your guests. Make sure to include warnings about certain effects, like strobe lights, which can trigger health issues for some attendees. For understanding local regulations and compliance \u2014 check out resources like the Life Safety 101 Code Book, which has a section on special amusement attractions. Additionally, be sure to draft a waiver for attendees to sign that acknowledges the potential risks involved with going through your haunt. This not only covers your legal bases but also informs guests about what to expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Launching your ticket sales\n\n\n\nReady to start selling your haunt\u2019s tickets? Let's explore how to effectively build your event page, price your tickets, and utilize event ticketing software features to streamline the process!\n\n\n\nCrafting a spooky event page\n\n\n\nYour event page is the first impression potential guests will have of your haunted house, so make it count! Craft a spooky, engaging event description that sets the tone and entices visitors. Use eerie imagery, haunting language, and highlight the unique aspects of your haunted house. The goal is to create excitement and anticipation, making people eager to purchase online tickets to experience the scares firsthand.\n\n\n\nSetting tantalizing ticket prices&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPricing your tickets appropriately is key to bringing in more guests while ensuring you make a profit. Research similar events in your area to get a sense of the going rates. Consider offering early bird discounts to encourage advanced sales and build buzz. This not only helps you generate ticket sales right out of the gate, but it also creates a sense of urgency for people to buy now. Additionally, think about different pricing tiers based on the intensity level or time of entry, giving guests options that fit their budget while maximizing your revenue.\n\n\n\nAdding your event waiver\n\n\n\nProtect yourself legally and inform guests of any potential risks by adding your event waiver to your online ticket purchase process. With a platform like TicketLeap, you can easily add this waiver to your ticket checkout. Your waiver should clearly explain any health and safety warnings, such as strobe lights or physical contact from actors. By requiring attendees to acknowledge and accept these terms, you can minimize liability and ensure everyone is aware of what to expect. This transparency helps build trust and ensures a smoother experience for all involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Marketing and promoting your haunt\n\n\n\nNow that your haunted house is taking shape, it\u2019s time to spread the word and fill those eerie halls with thrill-seeking guests!\n\n\n\nBuilding hype for your scare\n\n\n\nStart marketing your haunted house early \u2013 about 3-4 months before your event \u2013 by leveraging social media. Create engaging content such as spooky skits, teaser videos of your haunted house setup, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of your actors preparing to scare their victims (like a time lapse of getting into costume!). You could also host a costume contest or post a giveaway for tickets to generate buzz and get more people excited for your haunt. To go the extra mile, collaborate with local influencers and media outlets, like your local TV stations or newspaper, to spread the word. Invite the influencers you partner with to visit your haunt and share their experiences with their followers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEngaging your community\n\n\n\nEngaging with your local community can amplify your haunted house's visibility and support. Partner with nearby businesses for sponsorships to give you additional funds or donations in exchange for exposure at your event. With your sponsors, organize promotions like joint marketing campaigns or exclusive discounts for their customers who attend your haunt. This not only enhances your reach but also gives businesses in your community a fun way to reward their loyal customers around Halloween. Consider hosting community events or workshops related to your haunted house theme like a Halloween fundraiser or a pumpkin carving session to further integrate your event into local culture. By actively involving your community, you create a shared sense of excitement and ownership over the spooky spectacle you\u2019re creating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Conducting a post-event review\n\n\n\nAs the last screams echo through your haunted house, let\u2019s turn our attention to what comes next: gathering valuable feedback and assessing the success of your spine-chilling event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCollecting feedback from your haunt-goers\n\n\n\nUse a combination of surveys and social media to gather insights into their experiences. Surveys can be sent out via email or handed out at the exit, asking about their favorite scares, any areas they felt could be improved, and their overall level of satisfaction. Social media platforms are great for collecting more immediate feedback, encouraging guests to share their thoughts and photos from the event. Once you\u2019ve gathered feedback, analyze it carefully to identify trends and areas for improvement. Pay attention to recurring comments or suggestions, as these often highlight the most impactful changes you can make for future events.\n\n\n\nEvaluating your haunted house\u2019s success\n\n\n\nMeasuring the success of your haunted house goes beyond just counting ticket sales. Start by calculating your profit and expenses to determine your financial performance. This helps you understand whether your event was financially viable and where you might need to adjust costs for next time. Beyond finances, assess what worked well and what could be improved based on guest feedback and your own observations. Consider factors like attendance numbers, guest satisfaction levels, and any media coverage or community buzz you generated. Take note of successful promotional tactics to take advantage of again next year and areas where you may want to refine your operations or enhance the guest experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour haunted house journey begins here!\n\n\n\n\u200b\u200bCongratulations on embarking on the journey on how to start a haunted house! By now, you've learned the ins and outs of planning, designing, and executing a spooky and unforgettable event. From crafting spine-chilling scares to navigating safety protocols and legal considerations, every detail plays a crucial role in delivering a thrilling experience.

Whether it's bad weather, an illness, or some other unforeseen circumstance, canceling an event is one of the toughest calls you might have to make as an event organizer. But don't worry \u2014 we're here to help ensure you're prepared for anything! After all, it's always wise to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. With a few smart strategies in place, you'll be ready to handle any event cancellation that may come your way.\n\n\n\nWhen should event organizers cancel an event?\n\n\n\nYour attendees\u2019 safety and providing them the best experience possible is the number one priority! While canceling your event should be the last resort, here are some factors that'll help you discern if it's the right decision.\n\n\n\n1. Inclement weather\n\n\n\nThunderstorms, tornadoes, snow, or even extreme heat can force you to make the tough call to cancel. This is especially true for outdoor events, which are most vulnerable to these unpredictable elements. If you're hosting an event outside and you\u2019re expecting tough weather, booking a venue indoors as a tentative backup option can ensure you don't have to cancel. If the road conditions look too dangerous (especially in more snowy climates), canceling your event helps keep your attendees safe and off of dangerous roads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Low attendance\n\n\n\nOnce you've set your event budget, you'll have a clear idea of the attendance numbers needed to breakeven and turn a profit. If ticket sales fall short of your target, it might not balance out your event costs. When faced with low attendance, canceling the event can sometimes be the most responsible decision. To try and avoid this, having a strategic plan to boost your event marketing or to gain more sponsors could help bring more people in the door and boost your bottom line.\n\n\n\n3. Unforeseen circumstances\n\n\n\nUnforeseen circumstances can pop up at any time, and being prepared to handle them is key for any event organizer. Health concerns, such as a key speaker or performer getting sick, may force you to cancel if finding a replacement isn't feasible. Complications with your staff or issues with the venue \u2014 like unexpected maintenance problems or double-booking \u2014 can also lead to last-minute cancellations. So, remember, flexibility and contingency planning are essential! When these unpredictable challenges arise, making the tough decision to cancel can sometimes be the best way to protect your event\u2019s integrity and ensure future success.\n\n\n\nIs it better to cancel or reschedule?\n\n\n\nIdeally, having a well-thought-out plan B will help you avoid canceling or rescheduling altogether! If the issue is temporary like bad weather,, postponing to a later date might be the best option. Rescheduling allows you to maintain your event's momentum and gives your attendees something to look forward to without entirely losing the time and effort you've already invested. However, if the issues at hand are more long-term or unpredictable, a full cancellation might be more practical. Canceling may make more sense for seasonal events especially, such as a Christmas parade, a Halloween celebration, or a New Year's Eve party, where specific dates are crucial for success.\n\n\n\nBefore making the call to cancel or postpone, weigh all the factors carefully. Is the problem something that could be resolved by moving the event to a later date? Or is cancellation truly unavoidable? This is a big decision, so you want to be as sure as possible that this is the best route to take for your attendees and stakeholders.\n\n\n\nDeliberating with your team\n\n\n\nStill on the fence whether to cancel your event or not? Call your team together and get their feedback! It's a big decision that should have input from your key players, such as leading team members, guest speakers and their management, and your sponsors. While it's understandable that meeting with everyone may not always be feasible with their availability (especially if a fast response is necessary), a virtual meeting or call with those available can often suffice.\n\n\n\nDuring these discussions, you'll want to first see if any workarounds are possible to save you from canceling or postponing your in-person event. Once you've agreed it\u2019s best to cancel your event, it's time to discuss next steps. This includes determining what messaging to use when presenting this cancellation publicly and who'll be in charge of refunding ticket holders. For any staff who couldn't attend, make sure to contact them afterwards so they're on the same page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to cancel an event the right way\n\n\n\nWant to handle canceling an event as gracefully as possible? It's best to have a plan beforehand (with these tips below to help!) to give you more control over the situation.\n\n\n\n1. Stop selling tickets\n\n\n\nAs soon as you decide to cancel an event, shutting off ticket sales should be your top priority! Thankfully, this can be easily done with the click of a button. Acting quickly is crucial to prevent any further sales that'll need to be refunded. It's a good idea to include a clear cancellation policy on your ticketing page or website beforehand so attendees know exactly what to expect. This proactive approach will keep your audience informed and build trust with them.\n\n\n\n2. Email your attendees ASAP\n\n\n\nTo notify your attendees about the cancellation, send out an email blast as soon as possible! As part of TicketLeap's suite of features, you can send this blast to all your ticket buyers straight from your ticketing platform. Feel free to use one of our handy email templates at the bottom of this article to get you started. First, write an email subject line that clearly states your event name and that it has been canceled. Establishing a sense of urgency with a phrase like \"Breaking News\", \"Urgent\", or \"Important Update\" can hopefully help people click into your email as well.\n\n\n\nWithin your email's message, clearly explain why you had to cancel your event. If you're hosting multiple events, specify which date(s) and time(s) are affected. Knowing people have been excited and set aside time to come, show sympathy towards those disappointed by this news. Emphasize that their well-being is your top priority, particularly if the cancellation is due to health, safety, or weather concerns. Next, you must include details on refunds and rescheduling. Lastly, keep an eye on your inbox to promptly address any concerns from attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Post your event cancellation to other channels\n\n\n\nYou'll need to send out more than an email to alert everyone! This is especially important to do too in case they missed the email in their inbox, or it ended up in their spam folder. Here are a few other channels to share your canceled event message with your attendees.\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\n\nMost attendees are easily reached on their phones, so posting your announcement on social media will make it more likely that they'll see it in time. Then, they can also easily share the cancellation with any of their family and friends who had tickets too. Feel free to use the same message as your event cancellation email, but make sure it's within the word count of your selected social media platform.\n\n\n\nAs another idea, we recommend posting an apology video (on TikTok especially!) from the event organizer or special guests of your event to add a personal touch and demonstrate how much you care about your attendees. Another important thing: keep an eye on the comments. You'll want to make sure to clarify any additional questions people have, show compassion to anyone frustrated with the cancellation, and thank people for their understanding.\n\n\n\nYour website\n\n\n\nWhen canceling an event, it's essential to post a clear message on your event's website right away. Let your audience know about the cancellation and advise them to keep an eye out for an email from you with all the important details. Since inboxes can be flooded with emails and people's social media feeds fill with other posts, having this announcement on your website ensures it stays in an easy to find place for people to refer to.\n\n\n\nPress releases\n\n\n\nIssuing a press release is an effective way to announce the cancellation of larger events like a city block party, seasonal festival, or art fair. You'll want to write up an article to share with news outlets that covers all the main points regarding your canceled event. This includes your reasons for canceling, refund details, your plans to reschedule or not, and a heartfelt apology. This ensures that your local community is aware and builds deeper trust with them.\n\n\n\n4. Handle refunds with a personal touch\n\n\n\nWithin your event cancellation email, make sure you clearly inform your ticket buyers whether you'll automatically refund them or if you'll transfer their ticket to the newly scheduled date. Provide them with instructions on how to contact you with their request (whether through your support email or a phone number) and a deadline to contact you by. As for administering the full refunds, the process is super simple with TicketLeap! You can automatically pass those funds back to your attendees' accounts with just a click of a button.\n\n\n\nWhen you contact your attendees and as they reach out to you for support, be sure to thank everyone for their patience and offer to answer any additional questions they may have regarding their refund. If you need extra help managing refunds, TicketLeap allows you to use user roles to delegate team members the ability to issue refunds as well. Additionally, with TicketLeap\u2019s ticket exchange feature, attendees have the option to move their ticket to another event on your roster. This level of support will demonstrate your commitment to a positive customer experience, even in the face of unexpected changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Reflect and look ahead\n\n\n\nOnce everything has settled, take this opportunity to assess how your team managed the situation and identify where you can improve. Could communication have been even clearer? Was the refund process as smooth as it could be? If you're planning to reschedule, now's the time to reach out to vendors and confirm their availability for your new date. Make sure your venue can accommodate the change, ideally having a backup date already planned to avoid scheduling conflicts.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, send a follow-up email to your attendees with all the new details, including where they can find their updated tickets. Consider sending out a survey to your ticket holders to gather their feedback and make them feel heard regarding the cancellation too. Confirm that your guest speakers or performers are available for the new dates, and if not, start looking for suitable replacements. If low attendance was the reason for cancellation, reevaluate your marketing strategy and consider pivoting to different opportunities if necessary. By taking these proactive steps, you'll be better prepared for future events and deliver the best experiences possible!\n\n\n\nHow can I plan ahead for any future event cancellations?\n\n\n\nPlanning ahead is a smart move that can save you potential event cancellations down the road! Start by building a clear plan on how you'd handle such a situation, so you're ready to act fast if it happens. Decide in advance whether you'll offer refunds or allow attendees to hold onto their tickets for a rescheduled date. Communication is key, so determine what channels you'll use to announce (e.g., email, social media, website).\n\n\n\nYou'll also want to discuss your plan with the venue you've booked, any vendors, your sponsors, any guest performers, and more so they'll know exactly what would happen should your next event get canceled. As you make payments of your event's various expenses, you'll also want to determine which are refundable or not, or if you can receive a partial refund after a certain date. By having a well-thought-out strategy, you'll be able to manage cancellations smoothly and maintain trust with your attendees!\n\n\n\nConsider getting event cancellation insurance\n\n\n\nGetting event cancellation insurance can offer additional protection against unforeseen circumstances. Start by talking to your insurance provider about event cancellation coverage, which can help cover any financial losses from nonrefundable payments made leading up to your event. Some providers might only offer this type of event insurance for private gatherings like weddings, while others may be willing to insure larger public, business, or sporting events. The size of your guest list can also play a role in determining if your event is insurable.\n\n\n\nIt's essential to explore these options well in advance, as you can secure event cancellation coverage up to two years before your planned date. This ensures you're prepared for any unexpected changes and can confidently move forward knowing your investment into this event is protected. By obtaining the right coverage, you'll not only safeguard your finances but also reinforce your commitment to delivering a well-managed event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent cancellation email examples\n\n\n\nNo two cancellations are the exact same, so please modify these event cancellation announcement examples to your needs. These can also be modified to fit other channels, like social media or a press release.

And with the right event planning logistics, you can turn this wish into a success story. From choosing the perfect venue to coordinating with vendors, our guide on how to manage event logistics will cover everything you need to know to make sure your event runs smoothly! But first, let\u2019s take a look at what event logistics means.\n\n\n\nWhat is event logistics?\n\n\n\nEvent logistics is the secret recipe to cooking up a fantastic event! Think of it as the 'to-do list' that helps everything run seamlessly. From picking the right venue to making sure everyone knows where to be and when, event logistics is the game plan. For event organizers, getting this right means your event goes off without a hitch and everyone leaves with a smile.\n\n\n\nWhat you need to think about when managing event logistics\n\n\n\nWhen organizing an event, it\u2019s crucial to consider all those key details that can make a big difference. We\u2019ll break these examples of event logistics into manageable chunks to help you focus on what really counts!\n\n\n\n1. Venue\n\n\n\nWhen&nbsp;picking your venue, think about the vibe you're going for: formal, relaxed, or a mix. Then, size it up to ensure it can accommodate your guest list without them feeling cramped. You should try checking out the facilities. Maybe they've got some cool chairs or snazzy audio-visual gear you can use! But keep an eye on the price (including rental fees, service charges, etc.) so you find the perfect location within your budget. Also, don\u2019t forget to peek at reviews, as they can be a real eye-opener before you pay for the venue. If you're planning an outdoor event, have a Plan B tucked away for those raincloud surprises \u2014 like renting tents or marquees that you can quickly set up or reserving an indoor space nearby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Transportation\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need to ensure that all of your attendees can easily access your event, which means choosing a venue that\u2019s accessible by public transport. If your venue is close to the city, see how well your chosen venue connects by bus or train. And for remote spots, consider getting shuttle buses to help attendees arrive easily. You could also work with ride-sharing apps to offer special discounts for your event or set a spot for taxis. At the same time, you'll have people who\u2019ll want to drive themselves to the venue, so provide clear directions so they can get there no problem. Another idea is to suggest carpooling for attendees coming from the same area. Making sure everyone has easy and stress-free ways to get to your event will start things off right.\n\n\n\n3. Accessibility\n\n\n\nMaking sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable is key to a standout event! To do this, ensure you check for ramps or elevators for easy movement and clear signs to guide everyone. It's the little touches \u2014 like accessible restrooms, spaces friendly for those with sensory sensitivities, and even sign language interpreters \u2014 that show you've thought of everyone. For the digital side to your event logistics, like&nbsp;online registrations to learn about what special accommodations you may need, make sure to use a user-friendly platform like TicketLeap. After all, when everyone's included, the party's always better!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Parking\n\n\n\nEnsuring your guests have a hassle-free parking experience is like giving them a warm welcome hug before they even step in! Ensure there's enough space for everyone; perhaps even throw in a valet service for that extra touch of class (depending on the event type). And if there\u2019s a parking fee, maybe cover it \u2014 or at least give your guests a heads-up. Also, consider your attendees' safety and select a well-lit area with a watchful eye or two to ensure everyone's peace of mind.\n\n\n\n5. Vendor\n\n\n\nClear communication is essential when working with vendors. It\u2019s your job as the event organizer to make sure that all of the vendors (be it food, drinks, entertainment, decor, or tech) are aware of their roles and the timeline leading to the event. If you\u2019ve got an&nbsp;event budget, ensure you choose the perfect partners that can give you the best value for your money. Before you choose a vendor, check out their online reviews to get a feel for their service, and have a chat to ensure they resonate with your event's mood. And remember that things change, so team up with adaptable vendors. Once you've found the right vendors, jot down the agreements, including contracts, pricing, and deliverables. With the best in each field, your event is bound to leave everyone raving!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Accommodation\n\n\n\nFor your out-of-town attendees, speakers, or staff members, finding a cozy spot nearby is key. Look into local hotels (maybe get a group discount), charming bed and breakfasts, or check out well-reviewed short-term rentals like Airbnb. If your event has that community feel, some local attendees might even offer a spare room or sofa. And don\u2019t forget to ensure there's easy transport back and forth from your venue. At the end of the day, well-rested guests bring the best vibes!\n\n\n\n7. Event staff\n\n\n\nGathering the perfect team is like assembling a dream band \u2014 everyone brings their unique tune! Start by pinpointing roles, from security to event coordinators. While experience is golden, a brief training session will ensure everyone dances to the same rhythm. Also, keep an eye out for team dynamics; when everyone gets along, they handle hiccups like pros. And remember, a feedback channel can come in handy, as your team's on-ground insights might just be the cherry on top of a fantastic event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best event planning logistics checklist\n\n\n\nTo help you manage your event logistics like a pro, we\u2019ve whipped up a simple checklist to keep things on track! Here\u2019s a checklist on how to manage event logistics:\n\n\n\n\nFind a cozy venue that aligns with your event's vibe.\n\n\n\nEnsure ample room for guests and activities.\n\n\n\nMap out how guests will get to your venue.\n\n\n\nNail down parking details and any team members who'll help direct traffic.\n\n\n\nConsider tech tools or apps like the TicketLeap mobile app for fast event guest check-ins.\n\n\n\nPrep badges, wristbands, or tokens in advance, if you're using them.\n\n\n\nRound up your must-have audio-visual equipment like mics, projectors, and cool lights.\n\n\n\nTest your equipment to ensure a glitch-free experience on event day.\n\n\n\nJot down a timeline for vendor arrivals and departures, as well as map out where they'll be stationed at your event.\n\n\n\nTouch base with your food and decor partners.\n\n\n\nAssign roles to your event crew.\n\n\n\nKeep everyone in the loop about their tasks.\n\n\n\nScout for clear paths and easy exits.\n\n\n\nSet up first-aid spots and ensure accessibility.\n\n\n\nPut up signs to guide your guests.\n\n\n\nHighlight key zones like restrooms, food stations, and activity hubs.\n\n\n\nPrepare for any last-minute switch-ups.\n\n\n\nSketch out a plan for unexpected twists \u2014 rain, power outages, or a missing cake!\n\n\n\nEnsure everyone stays comfy and cheerful.\n\n\n\nOrganize the pack-up brigade.\n\n\n\nDo a final sweep to ensure everything's in order.\n\n\n\n\nManage your event logistics better!\n\n\n\nYou're now fully equipped with the essentials of how to plan logistics for an event! And when it comes to&nbsp;event ticketing, TicketLeap can be your best buddy \u2014 making the process a breeze.

From small conferences to large festivals, prioritizing inclusivity ensures a positive experience for all attendees. Read on to learn how to make events more accessible at every stage \u2014 before, during, and after!\n\n\n\nWhy accessibility at events matters\n\n\n\nAccessibility at events isn't just about meeting legal standards, rather it's a key part of being an inclusive, respectful organizer. Accessible events are essential to ensure everyone can participate and enjoy them. This commitment not only aligns with the values of diversity and equality but also shows that you care about all attendees' experiences.\n\n\n\nHow to make your events more accessible before, during, and after\n\n\n\nWe'll show you how to include accessibility in events at each step of your planning process. Consider this your checklist for planning accessible meetings and events, ensuring inclusivity from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do before the event\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how to make events more accessible during the initial planning stage:\n\n\n\n1. Send pre-event surveys\n\n\n\nSend out surveys to understand the specific needs of attendees, which can cover a wide range of accessibility concerns. TicketLeap lets you add custom registration questions at checkout to help you with these tasks. This way, ticket buyers can let you know about any special needs they may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Ensure the venue is well lit\n\n\n\nConsider the impact of strobes and dim lights on people with vision impairments, epilepsy, and those on the spectrum. Use clear signage for directions and locations. Additionally, ensure the visibility of projection screens from all seats in your event venue.\n\n\n\n3. Test venue accessibility\n\n\n\nCheck for nearby parking or public transit, elevator\/ramp access, and easily locatable gender-neutral bathrooms. Also, confirm the availability of electrical outlets for laptops and adaptive devices.\n\n\n\n4. Communicated accessibility info\n\n\n\nClearly communicate accessibility features in your event page and materials. Adding a simple line like \u2018our conference is wheelchair accessible\u2019 lets attendees with disabilities know what to expect. But ensure you use simple, readable text and include symbols that indicate available resources and accommodations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Check your event tech\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using an event app or website, ensure they are accessible to people with various disabilities\u2014including those who use assistive technologies.

Consider inclusive marketing\n\n\n\nUse diverse imagery and inclusive language in your marketing materials to represent a broad spectrum of attendees.\n\n\n\n7. Reevaluate your entrance fee\n\n\n\nConsider waiving the entrance fee for companions of guests with disabilities, as they are often essential for assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do during the event\n\n\n\nWondering how to make events more inclusive during the event? Here are a few tips to help!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Address individual needs\n\n\n\nStay proactive in addressing the varying needs of attendees. This includes ensuring sign language interpretation and catering to dietary restrictions. Communicate available services clearly in invites and announcements.\n\n\n\n2. Make communication lines accessible\n\n\n\nFor large events, setting up an \u201caccessibility desk\u201d near the entrance can provide direct support for attendees with disabilities. You can complement this by adding a dedicated hotline for assistance.\n\n\n\n3. Manage seating and layout\n\n\n\nPrioritize seating for persons with disabilities and ensure that pathways are free from obstructions. Doorways and aisles should be wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs, scooters, and service animals.\n\n\n\n4. Make presentations accessible\n\n\n\nEnsure that slides and presentations are accessible, with large fonts, high-quality images, and clear messaging. Consider offering audio descriptions and alternative formats like braille or large print materials.\n\n\n\n5. Provide a real-time feedback loop\n\n\n\nSet up a system for real-time feedback, such as a text line or app feature, allowing attendees to report accessibility issues immediately.\n\n\n\n6. Include accessibility ambassadors\n\n\n\nHave volunteers or staff specifically trained to assist with accessibility needs. Also, ensure they\u2019re easily identifiable by attendees.\n\n\n\n7. Create relaxed zones\n\n\n\nCreate areas where attendees can retreat from sensory overload, a key consideration for neurodivergent individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do after the event\n\n\n\nAccessibility continues even after your event ends! Follow these best practices for engaging with attendees afterward to maintain inclusivity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Provide inclusive event swag\n\n\n\nOffer swag items like T-shirts in neutral colors and various sizes, and consider the practicality of items for those traveling. Small, easy-to-carry items like laptop stickers can be a thoughtful choice.\n\n\n\n2. Collect feedback\n\n\n\nAfter your event, reach out to guests to enquire about their comfort and ability to participate fully. Use this feedback to learn and improve future events.\n\n\n\n3. Make sure your follow-up communications are inclusive\n\n\n\nEnsure all post-event communications, like thank you emails and surveys, are accessible and consider using multiple formats.\n\n\n\n4. Share your learnings\n\n\n\nIf you can, post a blog or report about the accessibility measures taken at the event and the outcomes. This will go a long way towards educating and inspiring others in the industry.\n\n\n\n5. Engage with the community\n\n\n\nBuild a community around your events that continue the conversation about accessibility and inclusivity, fostering ongoing improvements and advocacy.\n\n\n\nMake your events more accessible!\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve covered everything you need to know in this accessible events guide!

Whether you\u2019re a musician or an event organizer booking local talent, putting on a successful concert is no small feat. Crafting an unforgettable show is just the first step; the next is to master your music event promotion and get as many people into your concert venue as possible! Not to mention, there are a variety of marketing channels you need to tap into to ensure a packed house. But rest assured \u2013 we\u2019ve got some extremely effective tips to help you sell out your next concert!\n\n\n\nNow that you've got your next concert booked, it's time to sell tickets and gain new fans! When it comes to promoting your upcoming show, it's important to find a mix of marketing strategies that works best for the audience members of your genre and of the music venue. As the music industry constantly evolves, you\u2019ll need to adapt your approach in order to draw in more fans year after year. Now, let's dive in!\n\n\n\n1. Pre-plan your approach\n\n\n\nTo effectively promote a concert, start by setting clear goals and objectives to guide your event planning efforts. Determine what you hope to achieve, whether it's selling a certain number of tickets, raising awareness about your band's latest album, or growing your brand and your audience. Next, develop a comprehensive promotion plan that outlines what marketing channels you'll want to tap into and how.\n\n\n\nThis plan should include a timeline, target audience, key messaging, and channels you will use to reach your audience, such as social media, email marketing, and local radio stations. In this early phase, you'll need to evaluate your marketing budget (if you have one) and how to allocate those funds to the different aspects of your concert promotion plan. Proper budgeting will give you the opportunity to maximize your chances of success.\n\n\n\n2. Build your best ticketing page\n\n\n\nThis is where you\u2019ll hook people in! Make your ticketing page as enticing as possible to encourage people to buy tickets once they land here from all your other marketing efforts. Include an event description with the location, bios of the performers, and all the important event information that the venue owners would want attendees to know (e.g., parking, when doors open, any age restrictions). Add links to the artists\u2019 music so people can listen, and embed videos on your ticketing page to make it even more engaging! This footage could be of their latest music video or live videos of the act's best moments at other concerts, giving customers a glimpse into how awesome your concert is sure to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Blast it on social media platforms\n\n\n\nSocial media marketing is extremely powerful in the music business! The key is to use your social media pages to attract people near the concert venue, tapping into tools like Facebook advertising and location tags on Instagram stories to target people who live nearby.\n\n\n\nPost engaging videos!\n\n\n\nCreating video content, especially of fun moments from past shows, can really get attendees excited for what's coming next. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts are perfect for this. Building promo videos around the show dates offers a fresh way to invite people to your event.\n\n\n\nIf you're promoting concerts while in the local area, make videos experiencing the sites and community around the venue. Share a stitch or use a local spotlight video to highlight what you're looking forward to experiencing at the show when you're in town. As the band, you could also post updates leading up to the concert and create content around just how epic the live music will be. When you make and post videos, make sure to encourage people to purchase tickets to your concert event! Tag the venue, artists, and any sponsors so each of them can share it with their audiences as well. And don't forget to use location-based hashtags!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake full advantage of your Facebook event\n\n\n\nMake sure to post on all your social media accounts, but remember that using Facebook for your concert marketing offers some unique ways to spotlight your upcoming events! First, you'll need to create your Facebook business page if you haven't already. Then, create a dedicated Facebook event page for your concert, and send it out to your followers so they can RSVP. That way, their friends will see that they're going and they'll want to go too (thanks FOMO!). Don't forget to post in local music-related Facebook groups for more visibility from fellow live music lovers.\n\n\n\nTap into digital ads\n\n\n\nIf you have a marketing budget, you can run paid ads on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok that target specific geographic regions and music interests. It's important to allocate some budget for retargeting too since most people won\u2019t buy tickets the first time they see your ad. Make sure your ads meet two criteria: the audience should live near the venue and have some prior knowledge of you, like watching a music video you posted. You might also consider using Google Ads to drive traffic to your website, focusing on keywords such as \u201cfolk music near me.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Tap into your email list\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re a venue coordinator or an artist, it\u2019s important to build a strong following beyond just your social media presence. Your email list is a key way to do that. After all, these are the fans who are most invested in your story! Start by collecting people's emails on your own website through a sign-up form, and gather their zip codes too so you can segment your list based on location. Then, when you have a show nearby, you can email them to get them excited and encourage them to buy tickets.\n\n\n\nTo help grow your mailing list, offer incentives for people when they sign up, like a free sticker or song download. Consider doing a regular newsletter to keep your audience engaged with the latest news from your band or venue! Be sure to include a list of your upcoming gigs and remind them to get tickets. You can send personalized email invites or even send emails directly through TicketLeap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Leverage local SEO\n\n\n\nAs you book each show, keep your website up-to-date with all your concert details \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to boost your engagement with the power of SEO! If you're wondering what SEO is, it stands for Search Engine Optimization. This involves making improvements to your website, including by adding local keywords and phrases to help you easily appear in search results. That way, when people search for your band or are just looking for a cool concert near them, you\u2019ll show up! \n\n\n\nOn top of your website, don\u2019t forget to update your tour dates on Spotify as well. It's also a good idea to create a concert listing on local event directories and use third-party website integrations like Bandsintown or Seated. Finally, consider connecting with local influencers, event podcasts, and local websites to spread the word about your concerts.\n\n\n\n6. Market your show in person\n\n\n\nIn addition to promoting your concert online, there are plenty of ways to market your concert in person to drive even more ticket sales!\n\n\n\nCreate &amp; post eye-catching flyers\n\n\n\nOnce you've launched your ticketing page, you'll want to create physical flyers that include a QR code on it linking directly to your event page for easy access. You'll want to use large fonts, bold colors, and impressive images on your flyers to grab people's attention as they walk past. Once you've created your eye-catching flyers, distribute them in nearby communities, especially in locations close to the venue itself. This could include coffee shops, universities, and local businesses (with their permission of course!). Don't forget to leverage local event listings and community boards too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecruit a street team\n\n\n\nOne effective way to market your concert is to create a \"street team\" to hand out flyers, stickers, and other promotional materials for your upcoming event. This team can target high-traffic areas, popular local spots, and other live events where potential concert-goers are likely to be. Consider recruiting volunteers by offering them free admission, backstage passes, or exclusive merchandise in exchange for their help. With the help of your concert promoters, you can create a buzz and significantly boost attendance at your concert.\n\n\n\nPromote at other local shows\n\n\n\nFor artists, make sure to promote your concert at other events or gigs you might also have in the area. Take some time during your setlist to mention your next round of shows and where fans can find more information (e.g., your website, on social media). This is the perfect opportunity since the audience is already listening to you and loving what they\u2019re hearing! Additionally, consider booking a local opening act to draw in their audience as well as your own, especially if they're in the same genre. This way, they can also promote your show at their gigs too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet local businesses involved\n\n\n\nWant to take your concert marketing a step further? Try asking local organizations for help! More specifically, research if there are any local arts communities you can tap into. Ask if they\u2019ll give your upcoming events a shoutout, share your concert on their newsletters or in a blog post, and add your concert in the program for their shows. Also, have the sponsors of your venue or event spread the word about your upcoming concert too, and consider letting them give away some tickets to loyal customers in their audiences.\n\n\n\n7. Get the local media involved\n\n\n\nYou can get great exposure through TV appearances on local news and lifestyle shows, along with being featured on news websites, alternative publications, or blogs. Consider writing up a press release about your upcoming concert to share with all the media outlets as well. It's also super helpful to have an electronic press kit (EPK) from the musician or band to share along with your sample article detailing your concert. Shoutouts on TV and radio are awesome too. So, reach out to local music stations and podcasts, and they might even do ticket giveaways on air!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus tips on concert promotion!\n\n\n\nLooking for another effective strategy or two to promote concerts you've got coming up? We've got a bonus round of tactics for you to test out!\n\n\n\n\nHost a ticket giveaway on social media, where people tag 2-3 friends they'd like to go with to your concerts to be in the running for some free tickets (and maybe even a meet &amp; greet with the band!).\n\n\n\nThrow a contest for people to create their own TikToks, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts using the band's latest song. Pick your favorites, and give them free tickets to your next concert near them as their prize!\n\n\n\nTo encourage people to act fast, try using discounts on tickets for exclusive promotional campaigns.\n\n\n\nEngage with local influencers to help spread the word and generate buzz around your concert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s your time to shine!\n\n\n\nNow you know how to advertise a concert! As we talked about, you\u2019ll want to tap into a wide range of channels, from email marketing to in-person tactics, to ensure you bring in as many fans to your next live show as possible. Plus, understanding how to promote a concert on social media effectively will be essential to reaching an even wider audience. For the record, you don\u2019t have to brave this journey alone.

A Halloween fundraiser presents unique opportunities to connect with your community, boost visibility, and secure vital funds for your nonprofit's mission.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCommunity engagement\n\n\n\nHalloween events can captivate attendees of all ages! Not only do they bring people together over a shared love for all things Halloween, they also help connect your organization with those in your community who might not have otherwise heard about you. Fun activities such as costume contests, haunted houses, trunk-or-treat fundraisers, and themed games can help draw in people from all walks of life, setting the stage for an inclusive atmosphere.\n\n\n\nIncreased visibility\n\n\n\nHalloween fundraiser ideas can really make your nonprofit stand out and get noticed in a crowded market! Seasonal events are super shareable on social media, boosting your organization's online presence and drawing in new supporters who may not have known about your cause before.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEffective fundraising\n\n\n\nThe festive nature of Halloween-themed fundraisers makes it easier to incorporate creative fundraising activities such as raffles or auctions. They\u2019re also a great reason to sell tickets to haunt-related events like pumpkin patches. These can significantly amp up your fundraising efforts, allowing you to raise more money to support your nonprofit organization.\n\n\n\nHalloween-themed fundraiser ideas for inspiration:\n\n\n\n1. Spooky-themed bake sale\n\n\n\nWin over your community with a classic bake sale! For this fundraising idea, homemade baked goods are sold to raise money for your cause. This idea works particularly well because it\u2019s simple and appeals to anyone with a sweet tooth (which is a lot of people!). To put a spooky spin on your goodies, add designs like ghosts, witches, pumpkins, or bats with icing and fondant. Go the extra mile by incorporating fall-inspired flavors like pumpkin spice, caramel apple, or Halloween candy corn! When you\u2019re ready to spread the word, post about your bake sale on social media and share it with groups that are known to support your cause. Post flyers promoting your bake sale on local community boards to draw in more people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Haunted house tour\n\n\n\nA haunted house fundraiser can be a super creative way to sell tickets and fundraise for your cause. Start by selecting a suitable location with ample space for different scenes and props. Once your venue is secured, design a layout that guides visitors through a series of themed rooms filled with eerie lighting, spooky sound effects, and creepy decorations. Utilize your volunteers to add interactive elements like jump scares and hidden surprises. Lastly, it\u2019s extremely important to ensure that your haunted house venue meets necessary safety standards and that your volunteers are trained on emergency procedures to ensure a fun, safe haunted house event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Pumpkin carving contest\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for attendees to participate and get creative, then a pumpkin carving contest is the Halloween fundraiser for you! Participants can purchase an event ticket to enter the contest and those ticket proceeds can be used to fundraise for your cause. Pumpkin carving attracts participants of all ages, from college students to large families. To get this fundraiser up and running, set clear contest rules and categories like the scariest, funniest, and most creative. To take your contest a step further, give out prizes like gift cards donated by local businesses or sponsors that support your charity!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Pumpkin patch\n\n\n\nSimilar to our pumpkin contest theme, consider putting together a pumpkin patch! You can easily buy pumpkins in bulk from a local wholesale farmer and sell them at a more premium price to raise money for your nonprofit. Decorate your pumpkin patch with fall-inspired backdrops for the perfect photo op! Think bales of hay, autumn leaves, scarecrows, and aesthetic pumpkin arrangements. Add to your fundraiser by selling pumpkin decorating supplies! To make your pumpkin patch even more worthwhile, invite local businesses to sell snacks and beverages like apple cider, hot chocolate, and pumpkin treats!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Trick-or-treat trail\n\n\n\nTrick-or-treat fundraiser ideas are some fun ones to try! Consider a trick-or-treat trail where you plan a route with designated stops so participants can collect treats or play mini-games like cornhole or apple bobbing. Utilize all the spooky props you can think of on your trail like fog machines, cool lighting, and sound effects to create the perfect eerie atmosphere. To ensure your trail is followed as planned, create maps or provide signage to guide participants along the path and indicate crossing points. You can use the proceeds from your event ticket sales to support your selected charity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Costume parade\n\n\n\nBring the spirit of a good ol\u2019 Halloween party to the streets with a costume parade! A costume parade allows your participants to show off their personalities and design skills. You can work with your city to plan a route through a central location like a downtown area or community park. To add an extra level of fun, turn it into a costume contest with categories for different age groups or themes, like best group or most original costume. To boost ticket sales, collaborate with community organizations and schools to sponsor your upcoming Halloween fundraiser and offer prizes to the winners of your contest!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Horror movie screening\n\n\n\nFor these Halloween charity events, choose popular horror films or classic Halloween movies to show and sell a ticket to enter. You can even show them back-to-back as a movie marathon event and section them off in themes such as slasher, supernatural, or family-friendly. Be sure to schedule breaks in between films for the restroom, concessions, and a good ol\u2019 stretch. To set the mood, offer themed snacks such as vampire-themed cocktails (or mocktails) and caramel popcorn. Your screening area could even be decorated with cobwebs and jack-o\u2019-lanterns!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. DIY Halloween craft fair\n\n\n\nCalling all creatives! Invite your local artisans, crafters, and DIY enthusiasts to showcase and sell their Halloween-themed items. Set up booth spaces for vendors to share their artwork with your community. Then, to promote your craft fair, contact local media outlets, share it on community calendars, and blast it across your social media platforms. Put together a raffle where attendees can pay to enter and win a basket of sponsored items from local artists. To spice things up, provide opportunities for attendees to participate in hands-on crafting workshops to create their own Halloween-inspired decorations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Ghostly gala dinner\n\n\n\nA gala dinner is a super popular charity event idea, so why not make it Halloween-themed? Design a themed menu featuring dishes inspired by Halloween folklore, ghost stories, and other aspects of fall. Offer appetizers like deviled eggs with spider web designs, main courses like pumpkin risotto, and desserts like graveyard-themed cakes. Make your gala interactive by having volunteers read ghost stories, or set up fortune-telling stations with tarot card readings for after dinner. To benefit your nonprofit, set up a silent auction to raise funds for your cause while providing an unforgettable night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Zombie fun run\n\n\n\nWho would\u2019ve thought you could purposely invite zombies to run for a good cause! For this fundraising event, host a charity run but with a twist \u2013 everyone dresses up like zombies. Choose a scenic route or park for your zombie fun run, and even consider featuring different distances and difficulty levels depending on your runners\u2019 experience. To build your event\u2019s momentum, encourage early sign-ups using early-bird discounts and reward runners for hitting fundraising goals through pledges. Want to take your run up a notch? Consider seeking sponsorships for support and offer cool merchandise like T-shirts and hats to elevate your charity event's appeal!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Witch's brew tasting\n\n\n\nCollaborate with local breweries or distilleries to offer tasting flights! Then, either have the brewery donate a percentage of the proceeds to your selected cause or donate the drinks they share with attendees in exchange for promotional opportunities at your event. Work with your sponsor to brainstorm names that\u2019ll witch-ify your drink selections to match your theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Monster mash chili bash\n\n\n\nHost a Halloween-themed chili contest! Invite your local community to purchase a ticket to your chili-tasting event. For your contestants, start by setting Halloween-themed categories like \u201cSpiciest Hellfire\u201d (spiciest chili), \u201cBest Overall Cauldron\u201d (best overall chili), \u201cWickedly Vegetarian\u201d (best vegetarian), \u201cPhantom\u2019s Favorite\u201d (people\u2019s choice), and so on. Decorate your contestants' booths in different Halloween-themed ways to add to the spooky atmosphere and encourage them to bring their own themed cookware! As for your tasting attendees, create engaging activities like a \u201cchili passport\u201d and offer a prize to the attendees who have received a stamp for tasting every booth's chili!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Jack-o'-lantern auction\n\n\n\nLight up the night with a Jack-o\u2019-Lantern auction! Engage local artists, influencers, and community members to create pumpkins out of wood, glass, or any material they choose and put their artistic spin on them. Then, showcase your decked-out pumpkins at a public spot or online gallery for auction for your cause. Provide clear guidance on pumpkin size, carving techniques, and submission deadlines. Lastly, throw a lively auction event with a skilled auctioneer or emcee to spark spirited bidding and attract competitive offers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Spooky scavenger hunt\n\n\n\nEngage your community with a spooky scavenger hunt! Craft a set of clues and riddles leading participants to different spots in your area. Hunt down unique sites with history or cool landmarks to include on the scavenger hunt path. Add a spooky touch with ghost stories, urban legends, or historical trivia tied to the spots. Toss in rewards like gift cards, event tickets, or Halloween-themed goodies for those who complete the hunt successfully! All participants can purchase a ticket to your spooky scavenger hunt, and you can donate the proceeds to your selected nonprofit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Creepy carnival&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFood and games? Yes, please! Create carnival booths and classic attractions with a twist using Halloween themes! This could include a haunted house corn maze, pumpkin bowling, or a witch's hat ring toss. Have your staff or volunteers run the booths for a range of games for all ages so everyone can enjoy the fun. To benefit your fundraising efforts, sell tickets for carnival entry and game access. You can mix free and paid activities, as well as offer tickets or tokens for games. Have local vendors offer concession stands with snacks, drinks, and Halloween treats for additional funds!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe hope these ideas have you antsy to get your own Halloween-themed fundraiser off the ground!

It's the roadmap that guides event planners through the financial landscape of event planning, ensuring that every penny spent is accounted for and driving towards a successful outcome. Want to manage event budgets like a pro? We've got the tips and strategies you need for creating an event budget that'll fully prepare you for your next event, along with a free template for you to use!\n\n\n\nWhat is an event budget?\n\n\n\nAn event budget provides you the full event cost breakdown of your anticipated expenses against the revenue you expect to generate. Having an event budget proposal fleshed out will help you determine how much you should spend on things like venue booking, marketing, and staffing to stay within those budget constraints. Depending on how much revenue you plan to bring in, you'll need to be realistic with your spending in order to make a profit. With the help of a smartly-made event planning budget, you'll have a blueprint for what's feasible and what's not!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of event budgeting\n\n\n\nWith an event budget spreadsheet, you'll have way more control as an event planner over the financial aspects of your event. That way, you can ensure you're not overspending and know when you have wiggle room to spend a little more in certain areas. Managing expenses forces you to prioritize what you\u2019re willing to pay more for by sacrificing something else. You can also see how much cash flow you have to cover expenses as they come in.\n\n\n\nWith an event budget to keep you in check, you'll keep a clear record of all the actual expenses you're incurring and the revenue you\u2019re bringing in. Now more than ever, budget planning is super important as event planners' budgets get smaller amidst prices continuing to increase across the event industry. The decisions you make for your upcoming event will rely heavily on what fits into your total event budget.\n\n\n\nThen, by the end of your event, you can gauge your event's financial performance to see if you got the return on investment (ROI) you were shooting for. Your sponsors will also appreciate seeing their ROI from supporting your event as well. Plus, tracking all your revenue and expenses in a corporate event budget will also be extremely helpful later when tax season comes around!\n\n\n\nWhen should you create a budget for your event?\n\n\n\nThe sooner, the better! Your budget should be drafted as soon as you've confirmed that you'll be putting on an event, ideally during the brainstorming phases of your event planning. This early financial planning ensures that you're well informed that all major decisions are accounted for in your available total budget, preventing any potential overspending and allowing you to be strategic in how you use your funds. Most importantly, you'll want to get your event budget proposal finalized before making the major purchases for your event, such as venue rental, speaker fees, and other larger venue costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential steps for planning event budgets\n\n\n\nReady to build an event planning budget, but not sure where to start? We'll walk you through each event budget step, so you feel more prepared when you create your own. Let's jump right in!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Define your event goals and objectives\n\n\n\nWhen organizing an event, it's crucial that your financial planning aligns with the overarching goals you've set out to achieve. Your budget should be structured in such a way that it supports these targets, whether you're wanting to make a profit or simply need to break even. Think about the big picture of your event. What are your overall objectives? Is the purpose of this event to raise brand awareness? To bring your community together? To fundraise for a cause? Understanding the necessary costs to achieve these goals is essential in creating a budget that not only aligns with, but actively supports your event's success!\n\n\n\nStep 2: Assessing your event\u2019s scope\n\n\n\nAs you build your budget, it's crucial to account for the size and complexity of your event when projecting its related costs. You'll also want to get a good estimate of how many people might show up and get a sense of who they are. Predicting attendee numbers and understanding their demographics will help you forecast the more variable costs like food, drinks, and seating accommodations. Determining this now will help you prepare for the extent of your event's needs, from how many staff members to recruit to how big of a venue you'll need.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Identify and allocate funds for all potential event expenses\n\n\n\nTo start off, list every possible cost your event might incur, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nStaff costs\n\n\n\nVenue costs\n\n\n\nEquipment rentals\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nEvent marketing\n\n\n\nFood and catering services\n\n\n\nVolunteer expenses\n\n\n\nTravel and accommodation\n\n\n\nSecurity services\n\n\n\nWaste management\n\n\n\nDecorations\n\n\n\nInsurance costs\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've gotten those costs outlined, review data from previous events, or if this is your first event, do some market research to ballpark each expense. You'll want to sort your costs into two buckets: fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are those like the venue or equipment rental, which don't change whether you're hosting 10 or 100 people. On the other hand, variable costs, like food or staffing, definitely will change depending on the number of people you have. Remember, it\u2019s totally cool if your initial estimates aren\u2019t spot-on. A rough estimate is way better than no estimate at all. Plus, you can always tweak those numbers once you start getting actual quotes from your vendors. Keep things flexible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Identify all revenue streams\n\n\n\nNext, time to figure out how much cash you might bring in from different sources like ticket sales, donations, and sponsorships. Depending on what your costs are compared to your projected number of attendees, this will help you determine the ticket price levels to make a profit. You'll want to set your prices such that you're able to cover your expenses, but still low enough that people will be willing to buy them. Feel free to pick the brains of seasoned event pros to double-check your estimates. Then, with TicketLeap\u2019s powerful reporting tools, it's super easy to gauge how well your ticket sales are doing at different price levels, once they're on sale.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Establish a realistic budget\n\n\n\nWith all your projected expenses and revenue in a row, it's time to plug all your estimates into a template. During the early stages of your event planning, it could be helpful to create a few versions of this budget that adjust your variable expenses according to different numbers of attendees you may expect (e.g., costs for 100 vs. 300 people). To turn a profit, you'll need to keep your expenses lower than your revenue. For example, you could look at boosting your income through various channels like sales, sponsorships, exhibitor booth fees, and merchandise. On the flip side, think about ways to cut costs. Could you use a venue your organization already owns instead of renting one? What about opting for organizing a potluck instead of splurging on catering? And don't forget to evaluate your options for entertainment or speakers carefully. Every decision counts!\n\n\n\nGet a FREE event budget template!

We suggest having your team hold onto all receipts and make sure every expense or bit of revenue gets documented in a spreadsheet either within or separate from your event budgeting template. Remember to keep your budget flexible so you can adapt to what you thought you'd spend and what you actually spend. Trust us, it's a smart move to hold onto your receipts and keep detailed records, not just for budgeting reasons. They'll be super handy when it's time to do your taxes down the road!\n\n\n\nHow do you stay on budget for an event?\n\n\n\nIt's one thing to create a budget for an event. It's another thing entirely to stick to it. Having a solid event plan template in place is the essential first step to greater financial control, but there are also some other ways to ensure you stay within your margins. Here are some tips to help your event budget management!\n\n\n\n1. Compare and negotiate vendor quotes\n\n\n\nTo get the most bang for your buck, research and collect detailed quotes from various vendors of your major expenses, such as the venue you'll book. It's all about comparing their estimated prices to make sure you're getting the best deal. And remember, never just go with the first quote that comes your way! There's always room for a little negotiation with suppliers to snag better rates or packages, especially when you've got options to compare. Don't hesitate to tell the vendors you're comparing prices to try and work out the best offer for your event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Consider do-it-yourself alternatives\n\n\n\nWanting to save some extra money? Take a moment to think about what aspects of your event you can handle on your own instead of paying someone else to do it. Managing tasks yourself (and with your event staff!) like post-event cleaning, traffic control, or handling merchandise sales can help keep costs low, even if it takes a little more time. You could also get creative with various DIY decorations for your venue. It's all about figuring out what you're capable of doing yourself versus what you might need a little help with!\n\n\n\n3. Utilize free or low-cost options\n\n\n\nTake advantage of the resources you already have available! When it comes to staying on budget, tap into your local community for vendors, venue locations, and more. Rather than hiring a team to help at your event, you could scout out volunteers who can lend a hand in exchange for free admission into your event. You might also want to check out public venues or look for local partnerships that could offer you services at no cost.\n\n\n\nWith needs like audio visual equipment or other event technology, the big question you'll ask is whether to buy or rent. To determine what's best for you, think about if buying will save you money in the long run, especially if you plan to use it at future events. Otherwise, renting for a one-off event may be more suitable for your needs. When it comes to your ticketing, pick a powerful platform that's also super affordable. TicketLeap offers completely free ticketing software to event organizers, which means one less expense for you to think about!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Plan for unexpected expenses\n\n\n\nAs your event planning becomes reality, you should always set aside a contingency fund to cover unexpected costs that arise. Even for the expenses you're anticipating, the actual costs you may incur could be more than you initially planned at times, especially if it's your first time hosting an event. Plus, it's always wise to have a little extra cash tucked away just in case! A good rule of thumb? Set aside around 10-15% of your total budget for these unexpected expenses. It's like having a safety net, ensuring you're covered no matter what comes your way. And hey, if you don't end up needing it, you've got a little bonus left over!\n\n\n\nIt's your turn to build an event budget!\n\n\n\nNow, you know how to create an event budget! Remember, the perfect event budget is one that flexibly accommodates the twists and turns of event planning while keeping your financial goals clearly in sight.

Whether it's for personal or professional development, workshops are a valuable experience for attendees to learn new skills, network with others, and grow in knowledge together. Ready to learn how to organize a workshop of your own? In this article, we're here to provide expert tips that'll help you host a successful workshop from start to finish!\n\n\n\nWhy host a workshop?\n\n\n\nHosting a workshop event is a fantastic way to bring people together to learn and grow, providing participants the opportunity to acquire new skills in a supportive environment. Workshops offer a unique platform for individuals to expand their knowledge and enhance their skill sets, making them more confident in areas that interested them.\n\n\n\nThat's not all! Hosting classes is also about community building. They create a welcoming space where people, possibly nervous about trying new things among strangers, can feel more at ease. When done right, your workshop can facilitate networking and forge new friendships too. Participants get to meet like-minded individuals, share ideas, and collaborate. Plus, it may lead to future opportunities for your attendees! Whether it's gaining new skills, making new friends, or both, workshops have something valuable to offer to everyone who takes part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the best format for your workshop\n\n\n\nWhen planning your workshop, take the time to research popular formats within your niche and customize them to meet the needs of your target audience. Depending on the topic, you may host your workshop as a hands-on craft session, a skills-focused masterclass, or a lively panel discussion. There's a range of workshop types to choose from, such as skill-based sessions that are perfect for hands-on learning like cooking or cake decorating, informative workshops on topics like social media marketing, or interactive discussions that delve into the latest industry trends.\n\n\n\nIn-person or online?\n\n\n\nThe next important piece is to determine if you should host your workshop in-person or online. Both formats offer unique benefits! Online workshops allow for recordable sessions, interactive polls, a wider audience reach, and greater flexibility for the speakers you'd draw in. On the other hand, in-person workshops provide invaluable networking opportunities, more hands-on activities, and a more interactive learning experience. For in-person events, selecting a venue that accommodates your expected number of attendees comfortably is key. You'll want to make sure the venue can support your technical support needs, engage attendees in meaningful conversations, and have the essential tools to carry out your workshop demonstrations.\n\n\n\nCan't decide which one is best? Try a hybrid approach! You can sell tickets to a livestream of your in-person workshop, combining the best of both worlds! By balancing the perks of both online and in-person formats, you can create an engaging and accessible learning experience for all your participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey performance indicators\n\n\n\nFinding a few ways to measure the success of your workshop event is important to really capturing its impact. Knowledge sharing is what hosting workshops is all about, fostering an environment where ideas and insights flow freely. Lead generation is another critical factor, as it signifies the ability to attract new prospects and opportunities, especially in the networking component of your events. Brand awareness is equally important, indicating how well you've managed to imprint your identity in the minds of your participants. Networking opportunities provided during the event act as a litmus test for its effectiveness in bringing people together and forging meaningful connections too. Lastly, your workshop\u2019s success is in helping build community, showing your ability to create a supportive and engaging environment that lasts well beyond the event itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet a date and time for your workshop\n\n\n\nPlanning your next workshop or seminar and wondering how long it should be? The key lies in understanding the depth of your topic. Opt for an hour to a half-day session if you're introducing a new concept or idea \u2014 it's perfect for giving attendees a taste without overwhelming them. However, if you're diving deep and offering extensive training, a multi-day event or series of events will ensure that participants walk away with a comprehensive understanding.\n\n\n\nWhen scheduling your event, consider your audience's availability. Weekends or evenings are generally best for working professionals and to steer clear of school hours for student attendees. But don't just guess! Use tools like polls on social media to get direct insight into your attendees' preferences. Lastly, a word to the wise: do some extra research to avoid major scheduling conflicts in your area. You don\u2019t want to schedule your workshop during big local events or holidays, where others may have prior commitments. Maximizing attendance is all about timing, so make sure your event stands out by choosing the most accessible date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a budget for your event\n\n\n\nCreating a budget is essential when you start planning your next workshop. Start by jotting down all the possible expenses \u2013 think venue rental, speaker fees, refreshments, marketing, and any tech or supplies needed. Don't forget to factor in a little extra for unexpected costs; they always pop up! Once you've got your list, do some research or reach out for quotes to get realistic figures. Then, tally it all up and compare it with the funds you have or expect from ticket sales, sponsors, and more. It might take a bit of tweaking to get everything to fit, but with a clear budget in hand, you'll be on your way to organizing an event that's both memorable and financially manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan the workshop agenda and schedule\n\n\n\nWhen planning an engaging workshop, the secret lies in an exciting flow that keeps attendees hooked from start to finish. Begin by mixing up lectures with interactive activities, fitting in time for fun introductions, sprinkling in breaks for networking, and setting aside time for Q&amp;A sessions. And of course, don't forget those highly-anticipated lunch or dinner breaks! Remember, shorter, focused sessions of about 20-30 minutes pack a more significant punch than drawn-out marathon lectures. This way, you ensure that the content remains digestible and retains the audience's attention throughout.\n\n\n\nMake sure to schedule and share your agenda with attendees well in advance, so they know what to expect. Additionally, listing out your technical and A\/V needs for each session will help you avoid last-minute hiccups, especially if you\u2019ll need slides, props, or other materials to enhance your presentation. And a pro tip: since people's most unproductive time tends to be between 2-3pm, try to schedule your most engaging content for the morning and late afternoon instead. Or, should you have a session during this window, keep the energy up with a coffee break!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate downloadable materials for participants\n\n\n\nMake sure the valuable knowledge you share sticks with your attendees after the workshop ends! One effective way to keep the information alive is by creating different types of handouts, like key takeaway summaries, cheat sheets, or templates that attendees can easily refer back to. You could also spice things up by offering bonus downloadable materials just for those who registered beforehand. That way, they can better prepare for what your workshop has in store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild an exclusive landing page for your workshop\n\n\n\nCreating a dedicated landing page to sell tickets to your workshop is an absolute must. Make sure you've got an irresistible event description to capture the key benefits that attendees will gain. Lay out all the necessary information and expectations for your workshop. Will supplies be provided, or should attendees bring their own? If you're supplying materials, consider embedding the cost into the ticket price to help your bottom line. On your ticketing page, don't forget to showcase your speaker bios if you have guest speakers, provide location details or the link for virtual events, and spice up the page with videos and photos to ramp up excitement for your event!\n\n\n\nWant to create the ticketing page of your dreams? Use TicketLeap's powerful ticketing software to get the job done right! Use our checkout questions that help you understand how attendees discovered your workshop, or send email reminders with all the essential details to prepare them for the day. Whatever your workshop's ticketing needs may be, we've got you covered!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing your workshop to drive registrations\n\n\n\nSocial media is your best ally when it comes to your workshop's marketing strategy! Kickstart the buzz by sharing engaging snippets, insightful thoughts on the workshop's topic (like on Instagram!), and using relevant hashtags across all your social media channels. Consider creating short, helpful video clips for TikTok to spark interest among enthusiasts of your topic. You can also amplify your reach through targeted ads on these platforms, ensuring you connect with your ideal attendees seamlessly. \n\n\n\nDon't underestimate the power of email marketing to engage your existing audience too! Platforms like TicketLeap offer built-in email marketing tools in our suite of features, making it easier to communicate with registered attendees and boost your event's visibility. Make it a point to send out personalized email invites to past attendees, especially if you're hosting advanced-level workshops. Segmenting your email list based on interests can significantly increase engagement rates and ensure your message resonates with the right crowd too.\n\n\n\nLastly, everyone loves a good deal! Offering early bird discounts, half-price promo codes, and exclusive perks for those who refer their friends can help you sell more tickets and bring in more people eager to learn. Thanks to TicketLeap's user-friendly software, you can launch special discounts on your tickets in no time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage networking\n\n\n\nTo foster a sense of community and encourage collaboration in your events, consider using breakout rooms in online workshops or setting aside specific networking time during in-person gatherings. Planning fun team-building games can be a great way to build community, boost teamwork, and kickstart conversations among participants. Starting your workshop with a lively icebreaker activity is another fantastic way to encourage conversations from the get-go. Additionally, creating a dedicated online forum or Facebook group for attendees to connect after the workshop can keep the momentum going, allowing the connections made during your event to continue flourishing long after it's over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering feedback and evaluations for future workshops\n\n\n\nIt's a great idea to sprinkle in some feedback points to engage with participants and gather their insights in real time. Following the workshop, send out post-event surveys to collect a wealth of information about the attendee's experience. With this, you can determine what was successful and what areas need work. By analyzing this feedback, you can pinpoint specific areas for improvement, ensuring that future workshops are even more effective and enjoyable for everyone involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up and continued engagement with attendees\n\n\n\nAfter the workshop concludes, make it a priority as the event organizer to send thank-you emails to all your participants, expressing gratitude for their attendance and sharing resources for them to further their studies. Any valuable workshop materials you shared in your workshop, make sure to share with them afterwards to apply what they've learned. Additionally, don't be shy to notify them about future workshops, especially if it\u2019s about relevant topics! That way, you'll keep them in the loop and encourage continuous learning with each new session you host.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore tool tips specifically for online workshops\n\n\n\nFor virtual workshops specifically, it's a smart move to do a test run with your chosen platform before broadcasting the real deal. This step helps you smooth out any technical hitches, ensuring everything runs just right on the day. Also, give your tech a little extra TLC! Investing in high-quality audio and video equipment can make a huge difference, providing a seamless online experience that keeps your attendees hooked. And remember, interaction is key to keeping the energy up and your audience engaged. Use polls, Q&amp;A sessions, and breakout rooms into smaller groups to make your workshop not just informative, but also interactive and fun for your attendees participating from miles away!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, it's your turn!\n\n\n\nReady to transform your workshop idea into reality?

With the proper preparation, this process can be super simple. Luckily for you, we\u2019ve put together a thorough post-event cleanup checklist to make wrapping up your awesome event as easy as possible!\n\n\n\nBenefits of a thorough cleaning checklist&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs with anything, having a solid plan of what you need to do beforehand makes getting those things done a whole lot easier. With a detailed checklist of all the cleaning duties to complete at the end of your event, you can easily delegate tasks to your event staff so everyone is on the same page. This adds a bit more structure to the cleaning process and saves people from wondering what they should be doing to help after your event day wraps up. You as the event creator also receive peace of mind knowing that no stone is left unturned when it comes to cleaning requests from the venue space.\n\n\n\nBe sure to tailor your event cleaning checklist to your specific event venue to ensure all unique spaces are accounted for. You may even want to schedule a brief meeting with the venue\u2019s coordinator to clarify these exact needs. This reduces the chances of potential garbage or damage fees from your venue and fosters your relationship with them to hopefully use the venue again for your future events! After the event, you\u2019ll be confident you fully wrapped up the amazing experience you just curated, knowing that the cleanup is all taken care of.\n\n\n\nMaintaining a clean environment is crucial for ensuring a welcoming and enjoyable experience for guests! Not only will your post event cleaning checklist help you after the event, but it will also help you keep tabs on what to maintain during the event. Your guests will appreciate your attention to detail in the long run!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing for post-event cleaning\n\n\n\nFirst things first, discuss post-event clean-up with your venue ahead of time. You may find out if the cost of your venue includes clean-up services, or they may have services you can add on for a fee. If not, ask what their expectations are when it comes to cleaning. In this conversation, you should ask if they have their own post-event checklist for you to follow. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to make one yourself based on your notes from them. Next, be sure to locate where the cleaning supplies are in the venue, and determine if there\u2019s any additional cleaning supplies you\u2019ll need to gather before event day. Is there a carpet? Will you need a vacuum? What types of surfaces are there? Wood or stainless steel? These are just a few factors you\u2019ll want to consider when gathering the types of necessary cleaning supplies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPro tip: store your supplies in a concealed yet easy-to-find place so your team can quickly retrieve them after your event. The sooner they can grab the supplies, the faster the cleaning process will be! Beforehand, discuss with your event staff who\u2019s responsible for what during and after the event. Assign responsibilities like trash can duty or spill cleanup to distribute the tasks in a manageable way for your staff. Lastly, have a clear guideline for when post-event cleanup starts and ends, especially if the venue needs it done by a certain time.\n\n\n\nDuring the event&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf your venue doesn\u2019t include janitorial services, you\u2019ll need to determine who on your event staff will be responsible for refilling paper towels, soap, and emptying trash cans among other related tasks. You\u2019ll want to be sure to maintain the tidiness of the main event area as well. This is especially important for long events that span over a few days, like a festival.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-event cleaning checklist&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrum roll, please!

With an easy-to-use ticketing platform, you don't need any technical experience or coding know-how to build a custom event page \u2014 all you need is a few minutes to sign up. Once you've created an account, you can get started with an event listing that matches your brand and makes the buying process simple for your customers. Just add your basic info like your event's name, the type of event you're hosting, and the date into your event ticketing software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Add your event description and a picture\n\n\n\nThis is your chance to highlight what makes your event unique and cover the most important event details, like where and when your event is happening. Remember, you only get one shot at making a first impression!\n\n\n\nThink about who your target customers are and write your\u00a0event description\u00a0like you're speaking directly to them. In a few sentences, tell them what your event is all about. Be clear yet concise when explaining your value proposition: why should they come to your event? For example, if you're hosting a local festival, they'll be jamming out and making unforgettable memories with friends and family. If you want to\u00a0optimize your event website\u00a0even further, upload images and videos that pack a punch, make sure your site looks good on both desktop and mobile, and\u00a0link out to your socials. With all these added details, it'll be easy for potential attendees to search and find your event tickets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Create your event ticket types\n\n\n\nEnsure you've taken full advantage of the many&nbsp;benefits of your event ticketing platform&nbsp;including multiple ticket types (like general admission, timed entry, and VIP),&nbsp;event registration&nbsp;questions, and ticket offerings to multiple performances or time slots. You'll need to set your ticket price levels too, of course! If you're hosting a charity event, you could even create tickets that'll help you collect additional donations for your cause. You should also create various types of discount codes to help promote your events as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Set up how you'll get paid\n\n\n\nBefore your event goes live, you'll need to set up the payment method for your ticket sales. To do so, simply connect your bank account information to your ticketing platform and get paid via direct deposit. Typically, you'll receive payment a few business days after your event is over, so you can put the funds straight back into your event business. It\u2019s that simple! One last thing: you'll want to verify that whichever ticketing platform you choose is super secure in handling your customer data and your financial information. For example, TicketLeap is backed by Stripe, an industry-leading payment processor known for its security and reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:&nbsp;Launch your ticket sales!\n\n\n\nOnce you've created your event page, now you're ready to start selling tickets online! Once your ticket sales are live, be sure the link to your ticketing page is posted all across your social media and website, so people know it's time to buy tickets and can get theirs easily. As the event organizer, the best way you're going to get people to purchase tickets to your event is to shout it from the rooftops, so make sure you\u2019re sharing it wherever you can!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Promote your event\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;best way to sell event tickets online&nbsp;is to build buzz with a multi-pronged marketing plan including&nbsp;social media promotion, email blasts,&nbsp;sponsorships, and more. To sell the most tickets, be sure to start promoting your event months ahead of time and carry these efforts through event day.\n\n\n\nLooking for ways to bolster your&nbsp;event marketing strategy? Consider creating high-quality content of lineup announcements, giveaways, contests, and exclusive behind-the-scenes sneak peaks of your event to share across your social posts. Be sure to post to Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to draw in as many new potential ticket buyers as possible. Or, even consider offline promotion like putting up flyers across town to bring in more people from your area. Be sure to add our auto-generated QR codes to your flyers so passersby can quickly scan and buy tickets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Send out email invites and reminders\n\n\n\nLet's dive more into how to sell tickets online using email marketing, shall we? To build a buzz from the start, launch an email campaign to past attendees or newsletter subscribers to let them know about your next awesome event. You could also send personalized event invitation emails to get potential attendees excited to purchase their tickets.\n\n\n\nThanks to TicketLeap's built-in email marketing platform, you can send out these emails straight from our system, including an automated email reminder 24 hours before your event starts. In these emails, be sure to share important details on parking, admissions, and more helpful tips to make the event day experience as smooth as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 8: Manage any support needs\n\n\n\nWe all know that the road to a successful event can have a few bumps along the way. That's why having a robust ticketing platform that\u2019s there for you, rain or shine, is absolutely crucial. Whether it\u2019s handling ticket refunds or various other customer service requests, it should be super easy to get those issues taken care of quickly. Thanks to TicketLeap's mobile-first ticketing platform, you can handle customers' requests on the go straight from your phone. Plus, you've got a stellar support team that's as committed to your event's success as you are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Check in attendees\n\n\n\nA great ticketing platform will give you plenty of options that make it easy for you to welcome your guests and keep your admissions lines moving quickly on event day. Attendees should be able to easily print physical tickets or download them digitally, whichever they prefer. Then, use your platform's mobile app to scan tickets quickly at the gate, or generate a printable list of guests to cross off by hand. For customers looking to buy tickets onsite, use your platform's app for box office ticket sales to seamlessly admit them into your event as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Track data from your event tickets\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to sell tickets to an event online, you can generate detailed reports that will pull the data from your ticket orders in an instant. By creating custom reports based on your sales, orders, and attendees, you'll gain a deeper understanding of your entire event.&nbsp;Smart reporting tools&nbsp;also make it easy to keep an eye out for any red flags (like large orders or duplicate accounts) to help you avoid&nbsp;chargebacks. Plus, with the right ticketing platform, you can even connect Google Analytics to track the success of your campaigns and gain visibility into social media activity to find out which platforms are most popular with your audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 11: Build an audience for your next event\n\n\n\nAfter your event wraps up, those custom reports will especially come in handy! Send&nbsp;follow-up emails&nbsp;with surveys to your attendee lists to get their feedback and evaluate responses from your registration forms to help tailor your next event. Gauge which marketing strategies brought in the most sales and which can be better optimized. You can even consider sending out&nbsp;targeted email campaigns&nbsp;to inform your attendees of upcoming events and offer discount codes for future experiences that they can share with their friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMastering how to sell tickets online\n\n\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide on how to sell tickets to an event online, and you'll be on track to pull off your best event yet!

Pop-up events are an amazing way to get people excited about your brand and drive loads of engagement! Read on to find the best tips on pop-up event planning, plus a few examples of successful ones!\n\n\n\nHow do pop-up events work?\n\n\n\nPop-up events are temporary, surprise events that are hosted in unique places! As the name suggests, these types of events \u201cpop up\u201d in unexpected places like empty lots, art galleries, hotels, or even college campuses. Not only can these types of events build lots of hype around your brand but, depending on the length of your temporary pop-up event, they are also known for maximizing your ROI! You can reap all the benefits of hosting an event, while cutting typical costs in half like venue and event staffing, since your event is only for a limited time. This type of event can work wonders in any industry and for any organization, small or large!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow long should a pop-up event be?\n\n\n\nYour pop-up event can be however long you\u2019d like! There\u2019s no right or wrong answer because it all depends on the unique needs of your event. It can be daily or a few hours for a week, or it could even last a month or more. The way you structure the dates and times of your pop-up event should be chosen based on the goals of your event and your target audience. Take Penguin Life, for example, a publishing group that decided to host a pop-up bookshop event on International Women\u2019s Day. Since their goal was to showcase titles by female writers, Penguin Life strategically chose to host it on International Women\u2019s Day to take advantage of the trend of seasonal pop-ups. They also donated their ticket sale proceeds to a women\u2019s nonprofit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips on how to plan a pop-up event\n\n\n\nEager to put on this type of event yourself? It\u2019s time to take notes! Here are a few tips on how to plan a successful pop-up event!\n\n\n\n1. Determine a clear goal\n\n\n\nA pop-up event should have a very specific goal. Think beyond ticket sales: do you want to increase brand awareness? Are you wanting to bring your community together around a shared interest? How about promoting a new campaign? These are just a few examples of the types of closely targeted goals you can aim to achieve. Determining your goals will also help you design the entire event, from how it\u2019s laid out to how you measure your success.\n\n\n\nFor instance, Paka, a company that makes sustainable clothing from alpaca wool, wanted to go offline and connect with people in real life for its brand. Since the vision was to connect with others, the founder went on tour with two alpacas and was able to build a devout following by offering free alpaca hugs. He also gave out gift cards to attendees to buy Paka\u2019s clothes in exchange for sharing their email addresses. This is a great example of how the founder\u2019s specific vision helped design the layout of their pop-up event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Select an event venue that aligns with your target audience&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYour pop-up venue should be super easy for attendees to get to! Think about where your target audience spends the most time and plan to host it in a space that\u2019ll draw in a lot of traffic from them. For instance, if you\u2019re raising awareness for the importance of healthy sleeping habits and are targeting college students, why not host your event on a college campus? This way, you\u2019ll receive a lot of foot traffic from students going to and from class.&nbsp;Your venue should also adapt to the needs of your event. If you need outlets or audio equipment ahead of time, choose a venue that\u2019s able to accommodate that. Your location sets the stage for the atmosphere you\u2019re trying to create, so they both must align. For example, we wouldn\u2019t want a selfie museum in a location that has poor lighting! The neat thing about these temporary events is that you can have multiple locations. If you have a few ideal pop-up venues in mind, consider going to the next one after your first one wraps up, so you can reach a wider audience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Consider event logistics ahead of time\n\n\n\nEven if your event doesn\u2019t run for very long, there are still accessibility regulations and permits that are necessary to host your incredible pop-up! To save you an extra step, it may be best to select a location that already complies with these guidelines like a hotel, restaurant, or art gallery. Consider all factors that\u2019ll go into your event, like where people will park, how you\u2019ll check people in, or what kind of food and beverage service you\u2019ll provide. Regarding this last piece, there may be certain rules regarding how close a food truck can be to a brick-and-mortar restaurant as well as licenses to obtain to serve alcohol. These are just a few of the event logistics that should be squared away ahead of time to prepare for a smooth event, so it\u2019s best to meet with the coordinator of your selected venue to work out all the details.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4. Collaborate with potential sponsors\n\n\n\nSince your pop-up is meant to bring people together over a shared interest, why not partner with a loved local business that\u2019s tied to what your pop-up event is all about? Select a sponsor whose audience is similar to yours so you can tap into their audience too! For example, if you\u2019re hosting a pop-up shop selling essential oils, perhaps partnering with a local yoga studio can reach the right crowd. The right partnership will help enhance your attendees\u2019 experience, foster a positive brand image online for your organization, and build trust with your audience. You\u2019ll reap benefits from having your sponsor help market your event too, driving more traffic to your pop-up!\n\n\n\n5. Use event ticketing software to create a unique event page\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re hosting an event, you\u2019ll need to get your tickets on sale! Whether your event tickets are free or for a price, using event management software makes this process so much easier! Create a unique event page fully dedicated to your event branding so your attendees can easily purchase tickets online. TicketLeap allows you to quickly design a vibrant event landing page that\u2019s as exciting as your pop-up! Our intuitive ticketing system also makes it really easy to send email campaigns to your next event or send post-event surveys to gain feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Write a compelling pop-up event description\n\n\n\nTo pair with your event page, create a compelling event description that gets your attendees hype for your event! Your pop-up event description should be exciting and generate buzz by clearly detailing the value of attending your event. We know you know why the event is awesome, so be sure to capture that in a way that tells your attendees why your in-person event is worth coming to. It should also incorporate relevant keywords about your event (e.g. the topic of your pop-up, and the location) so your attendees can easily find your event in search results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Amp up your pop-up event marketing\n\n\n\nA crucial (and super fun) piece of your event\u2019s success is your pop-up event marketing! The key to marketing your pop-up is to make quality video content consistently, that showcases the uniqueness of your pop-up event. Tapping into the power of TikTok, you could create teaser and behind-the-scenes videos to build excitement prior to the event. On top of TikTok, post stories every day on your other social media platforms too (like Instagram!) to keep the momentum going and excite more people to attend! Some effective ways to engage your audience prior to the event are by doing live streams, giveaways, or polls.\n\n\n\nAlong with your social media efforts, write a press release to the local news outlets and secure some TV spots for maximum coverage of your pop-up. The idea of pop-up events was built on out-of-the-box thinking, so apply this to your event marketing! For instance, think about what you can include in your event to promote User Generated Content (UGC)! UGC from attendees at your pop-up is super valuable for the exposure of your event to wider audiences. Perhaps you include an aesthetic photo-booth and encourage attendees to snap a selfie and share on their social media using a dedicated hashtag for your event. Spice things up by hosting a social media give away for a lucky attendee who posts and uses your hashtag! This way your event-goers are incentivized to share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Keep the conversation going with event swag&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe excitement doesn\u2019t have to end once your pop-up is gone. Go the extra mile by handing out event swag during and at the end of your event. This way, you build brand recognition while also staying top of mind to your attendees long after you\u2019ve left! And don\u2019t forget to send a post-event thank you email to show your appreciation to those who supported your pop-up! You can even send exclusive details about your future pop-up to those who attended this one to get the hype started early.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow do you measure the success of a pop-up event?\n\n\n\nTo measure the success of a pop-up event, you need to take a look at your event\u2019s goals. Were you able to achieve the amount of ticket sales you\u2019d hoped? Did you meet your hyper-targeted goal? For instance, if your goal is to sell a product, then you may want to look at foot traffic to conversions. This means taking a look at how many people who physically visited your pop-up purchased a product. Similarly, if your goal was to build your email list for an upcoming campaign, then your event success can be measured by how many emails you were able to collect.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinal words\n\n\n\nWell would you look at that, you just learned how to plan a pop-up event! In order to host a successful pop-up event, you\u2019ll need to set targeted goals and plan out every detail to achieve them. Square away event logistics, marketing, and partnerships ahead of time to help you put out the most successful pop-up event you can. And consider working with ticketing software like TicketLeap to set up your awesome event page and get assistance from their friendly support team every step of the way!\n","date":"18 Apr 2024","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/AdobeStock_525985495-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

But how do you know if your event was truly successful? As an important tool for measuring event success, a post-event survey allows you to gather valuable thoughts, opinions, and suggestions from your attendees while your event is still fresh on their minds. By asking the right questions in your post-event survey, collecting this meaningful data will allow you to improve your current event as well as make future ones even better. In this article, we've compiled a list of 15+ post-event survey questions that you can use to gather valuable feedback to help improve your next event. \n\n\n\nWhy post-event surveys are important\n\n\n\nGathering valuable feedback directly from your attendees (aka, zero-party data) is a game-changer for any event planner. It provides you with actionable insights straight from your fans that are crucial for improving future events. You'll know exactly what worked and what didn\u2019t \u2014 be it guest speakers, sessions, specific haunted attractions, or some other aspect of your event. This clarity means no more guessing games; you'll have a clear roadmap of what your audience loves about your events, and how you can build bigger and better events. \n\n\n\nMoreover, acting upon these post-event surveys will make your current event attendees feel heard and valued. This strengthens their connection to your events, making them more likely to return in the future, and builds a firm foundation of trust. By understanding which channels brought in the most attendees, you can hone your future event planning and marketing strategies to be more effective and efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices for your post-event survey questions\n\n\n\nAs you build out your post-event survey, here's the lowdown of some important tips to keep in mind to make it the best possible source of attendee feedback!\n\n\n\n\nKeep it short! It's best to keep your post-event survey short and sweet so it takes only 3-5 minutes maximum to complete. Good rule of thumb: the quicker the survey, the more event attendees will fill it out. This typically would end up being between 5-10 questions.\n\n\n\nShow how you're tailoring future events to their feedback! Tell people how past feedback has impacted your current attendee experience and made it better \u2013 it'll motivate them to share their feedback this time too.\n\n\n\nEncourage people to be honest! Negative feedback is just as valuable and constructive as positive comments, as this gives you candid insight on areas for improvement and shows you truly value your attendees' opinions.\n\n\n\nSweeten the deal! Consider offering a perk as a little thank you for responding to your post-event survey, like discounts on future tickets or a chance to win gift cards, free tickets, or something else really cool in a raffle. You\u2019ll want to be careful with this though, since incentives can also potentially dilute the quality of your survey results, since some may just complete your form for the sake of the reward and not for giving honest feedback.\n\n\n\nKeep things flexible! While you should require answers to your most important questions (especially ones that are easier to answer, like multiple choice), it's best that not every question is a must-answer. Mix up optional and required questions, leaving the more in-depth long answer questions optional for anyone with additional thoughts to share.\n\n\n\nGive a gentle nudge! If someone doesn\u2019t answer your survey, feel free to follow up one or twice over the next two weeks after your event. Let them know how much you value their thoughts to help improve next year's event.\n\n\n\nBe prepared! Create your post-event survey questions well before your event ends, so that once it does, your survey will be ready to go to send to attendees!\n\n\n\n\nNeed help getting started on your post-event survey? We've got a free template for you to check out and use below!\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Our Free Template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of questions for post-event surveys\u00a0\n\n\n\nTo gather your data as accurately as possible, there's a variety of event survey questions you can use to collect feedback from your attendees. Some will provide you with more qualitative data while others will be more quantitative in nature. It just depends on the types of attendee feedback you'll need for your upcoming events.\n\n\n\n1. Multiple choice questions\n\n\n\nWhen designing multiple choice questions for an event survey, it's common to use closed-ended options such as \"yes\" and \"no\", \"true\" and \"false\", or a list of simple phrases related to your question topic. These questions are especially popular because of how straightforward they are, allowing for quick responses from your participants. For more nuanced answers not captured in your list of answers, it's a good practice to include an open field or an \"Other\" option. This addition ensures that while you benefit from the structured format of closed-ended questions, you still get every inch of the valuable feedback you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Matrix questions\n\n\n\nUtilizing matrix questions in a post-event survey is an efficient way to collect feedback on a number of questions at once. By presenting multiple statements or questions within a single table, respondents can easily provide their answers across a numerical scale (e.g., levels of satisfaction). This not only makes it easy for previous attendees to provide feedback on multiple areas in rapid fire, but it makes comparing the data across each event survey question easier for the event organizer to analyze later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Rating scales\n\n\n\nThese questions help turn opinions into numbers, allowing you to gather quantitative data to best gauge attendee satisfaction. You'll want to provide context to the numbers on your scale's spectrum, such as \"very likely\" to \"very unlikely\". The most common of these is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which asks attendees how likely they are to recommend your event to a friend on a scale from 1-10. On the NPS scale specifically, you can calculate your final NPS score by calculating your percentage of promoters (the 9-10 range) minus the percentage of the detractors (6 and below). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Likert scales\n\n\n\nBy using a likert scale, participants can indicate how much they agree or disagree with a statement to help organizers gauge the overall sentiment. As a more specific type of rating scale, likert scales typically use a scale of 5 or 7 for a more nuanced view of participants' experiences. Whether it's assessing the satisfaction with the event's content, the venue, or the overall experience, likert scale questions help ensure that future events are even more successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Dropdown questions\n\n\n\nDropdown questions provide a group of fields for event attendees to select from for their answer. This makes it super straightforward for respondents to select from a comprehensive list of options, making it easy to gather insights about your target audience. Instead of using a multiple-choice question with a ton of answers to pick from, dropdown questions offer a more consolidated approach, allowing for an extensive range of answers without overwhelming the participant. This could include asking questions about their demographics (like age range), their favorite speaker, or what their preferred social media platform is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Open ended question\n\n\n\nThis question type is most effective in uncovering feedback you might otherwise not have discovered. Unlike the other question types above that are quantitative in nature, these open-ended questions (either short or long answer) gather qualitative data. Your attendees can share any positive or negative sentiments in their own words that they wouldn't have otherwise been able to share in your other questions. These questions take longer to answer, so it's best to keep them optional in your survey so people have an outlet to share their thoughts if they want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of post-event survey questions\n\n\n\nCongrats! Now that you know the types of post-event survey questions you can choose from, let's figure out the questions you'll ask! To help brainstorm, here are some examples of questions for three different audiences: your attendees, event sponsors, and your staff. \n\n\n\nQuestions for your attendees\n\n\n\n1. How did you hear about our events?\n\n\n\nHear firsthand from attendees on what marketing channels are bringing them in, whether it's your social media posts, your emails, word of mouth, etc.\n\n\n\n2. Was the event structured well?\n\n\n\nThis is likely a rating-style or open-ended question, one that's fitting especially for corporate events, conventions, and events with a number of sessions.\n\n\n\n3. How would you rate the location?\n\n\n\nThese quick assessments of various aspects of your event are perfect to incorporate in a matrix-style survey question. You could ask them to rate other aspects on a numerical scale too, such as the parking, public transit options, and more.\n\n\n\n4. How likely are you to attend next year's event?\n\n\n\nSuccessful events keep people coming back for more, so this will help gauge if your annual event met that goal! Using these responses can help you with forecasting your event growth as well.\n\n\n\n5. How likely are you to attend other events of ours?\n\n\n\nThis will help you gauge if people are interested in attending future events (you could even give a few examples) beyond just the one they attended.\n\n\n\n6. How likely are you to recommend this event to a friend or family member?\n\n\n\nRemember that Net Promoter Score? This question helps event organizers determine how many of their attendees will promote your event to others and likely they'll attend future events with their friends!\n\n\n\n7. What was your favorite moment at our event?\n\n\n\nThis open-ended question gives your attendees the space to share specific positive stories about your event. With their consent, this is a perfect opportunity to gather testimonials to feature on your event website and future ticketing pages as well!\n\n\n\n8. Was the signup process for our event easy? \n\n\n\nDetermine how smooth the ticket purchase process was to identify any hold ups that might have prevented others from buying their tickets. This could be particularly insightful if your attendance numbers were less than expected.\n\n\n\n9. How could we have improved your experience?\n\n\n\nThis is powerful for gathering feedback on how to improve future events! Leave this as an open-ended question to allow attendees to voice their opinions candidly to help your next event.\n\n\n\n10. Have you attended our events before?\n\n\n\nDiscover how many of your attendees are regulars! You could even ask for them to give an estimated number of events they've been to before to further gauge their loyalty.\n\n\n\n11. What topics do you hope to see more of at future events?\n\n\n\nAsking this allows you to hear what sessions or activities were best, straight from attendees. Depending on your event type, you could also ask different forms of this question, like asking about their favorite performers, attractions, and more.\n\n\n\n12. Did the event meet your expectations?\n\n\n\nEnsure your attendees can share their constructive feedback here with this open-ended question. That way, you can take any deficits that might have arisen and address them in your future event planning.\n\n\n\n13. Demographic-specific questions about education, age, location, etc.\n\n\n\nAsking your attendees to share a bit about themselves, whether that be their age range, where they're from, or how many people are in their family, can help you gather important information to better understand your target audience and better tailor your experiences to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for your event staff and volunteers\n\n\n\n1. Would you consider our event successful? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nAsk your event staff for their honest thoughts! As key players in your event's success, their insight on what works well and what didn't will be essential for improving future events.\n\n\n\n2. How can we improve our event operations in the future?\n\n\n\nThis is a great opportunity for your event staff to share any suggestions for your future events, like a change in location, selected speakers, or improvements to team communication.\n\n\n\n3. Did you feel prepared to assist with the event?\n\n\n\nEspecially important for your volunteers or new staff members, make sure that your team feels properly trained to help run a successful event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions for your sponsors\n\n\n\n1. Did you get all the information you needed before the event?\n\n\n\nThese types of follow up questions allow you to best streamline your event operations, so it's a pleasant experience not just for attendees, but for your sponsors too.\n\n\n\n2. How can we improve your event experience in the future?\n\n\n\nThis shows your event sponsors how much you care about them and can use this constructive feedback form your post-event survey to encourage and enhance their future sponsorships at your next event.\n\n\n\n3. Did you have ample networking opportunities at our event?\n\n\n\nSponsors are looking for chances to build their network and make connections, whether with attendees or fellow vendors at your event. Asking about this ensures they feel heard and got the opportunities they were looking for.\n\n\n\n(Bonus!) Pre-event survey questions\n\n\n\nA pre-event survey can help you improve future events as well as this one! Here's a few questions you could include in a pre-event survey to help plan your next event before it happens. Within TicketLeap's suite of features, you can also embed some of these questions in your checkout process as event attendees buy their tickets! Here are some pre-event question ideas to help you get the ball rolling.\n\n\n\n1. Are there any special accommodations we should be aware of?\n\n\n\nAsking this shows that you value inclusivity at your events. This will allow you to prepare in advance for any accessibility concerns for attendees that may need it.\n\n\n\n2. Do you have any food allergies?\n\n\n\nIf you are serving food at your event, this is a critical question to ask, ensuring that any attendees with dietary restrictions are able to enjoy eating at your event worry-free.\n\n\n\n3. How did you hear about our event?\n\n\n\nDetermine which marketing channels (email, social media, TV, etc.) are bringing in your upcoming attendees, so you can hone in on those more popular channels in the remaining weeks leading up to your event.\n\n\n\n4. What are you most excited for at our event?\n\n\n\nThis question will allow you to gauge which sessions, guest speakers, performers, etc. will likely be the most popular once your event day arrives.\n\n\n\n5. Have you attended this event in the past?\n\n\n\nFrom the get-go, this helps give you a better idea of who's a returning attendee versus who's coming for the first time, so you can better tailor their event day experience.\n\n\n\n6. What's your favorite social media platform?\n\n\n\nUse this question to determine which social media platforms to focus on in your event marketing efforts, so you can maximize your event\u2019s reach.\n\n\n\nWays to collect post-event feedback&nbsp;for future events\n\n\n\nWhile tons of platforms exist to host your post-event survey, here are some starting places of survey platforms to use for measuring attendee satisfaction.\n\n\n\nSurvey Monkey\n\n\n\nSurvey Monkey is a powerful virtual platform with tons of survey question types, over 250+ customizable templates, and even AI tools to help build your post-event surveys with maximum efficiency.\n\n\n\nGoogle Forms\n\n\n\nAs a part of Google's suite of solutions, Google Forms is a straightforward (and totally free!) way to create a simple yet dynamic form to gather your post-event survey data.\n\n\n\nTypeform\n\n\n\nPerfect for gathering your event feedback to improve future planning efforts, Typeform makes it easy for you to build beautifully branded post-event surveys&nbsp;with all the question types you need.\n\n\n\nJotform\n\n\n\nYou can build powerful event surveys with Jotform, complete with automated workflows, dynamic reporting for planning future events, and more to save time for your event organization.\n\n\n\nSurveyPlanet\n\n\n\nSurveyPlanet allows you to easily create free surveys with unlimited numbers of questions and responses, custom branding, pre-written templates, and more.\n\n\n\nHow to best share your post-event survey questions\n\n\n\nOnce you've made your form, you're probably wondering when and where to best post your follow up questions? Ideally, you'll want to get your survey out there within the first day or two after your event, while your successful event is fresh on people's minds! As a strong option, you could send a post-event follow-up email with a call-to-action button directing people to your survey. Luckily, with TicketLeap, you can send this survey email directly from your ticketing platform to help streamline your event marketing efforts. \n\n\n\nYou can also post a QR code of your survey's link onsite for attendees to see in person as they leave your event. To encourage more responses, feel free to sweeten the deal with an incentive like adding their name to a raffle or earning a ticket discount on your next event. Sharing the survey on your website or social media could also be a good idea, though keep in mind that you may risk receiving feedback from people who weren't actual attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant note: whenever asking for feedback, ensure you get their consent before sharing it! This is especially important for any glowing feedback you got in your long-answer questions that you'd like to feature as a testimonial on your event website. To do this, you could add a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" question asking for their consent at the bottom of your survey.\n\n\n\nA few last words\n\n\n\nUltimately, creating a comprehensive list of survey questions for event feedback is essential for any event organizer wanting to improve their future events. By carefully selecting a mix of question types and using our best practices to guide you, you can gather powerful metrics to better understand what worked well and what could use improvement for future events. Remember, the goal is not just to measure your event's success but build stronger connections with your attendees, making them feel valued and heard.

Lucky for you, with our team's extensive research, we\u2019ve solved the mystery! Read on to learn tips on how to craft compelling event subject lines and equip yourself with 45 ideas to test out for your next event email.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy event email subject lines are so important\n\n\n\nEvent email subject lines are your first impression to potential attendees. It\u2019s the deciding factor on whether or not your recipient opens your email to read more and ultimately buy their tickets to your upcoming event. This is why you must get it right! It\u2019s been said that 47% of recipients will open an email based on your subject line, while 69% of recipients will report spam based on the subject line. This statistic shows just how important this element is in making or breaking your email. But fear not! We have tips and tricks for your subject lines that can boost your event email open rate!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow your audience&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo start writing the perfect email, you\u2019ve got to know exactly who you\u2019re writing to! By now in your event planning process, you should have a good read on who your target audience is with the help of your surveys, custom questions at checkout, follower demographics on social media, and more. This is super important because understanding what resonates with your audience is key to crafting an event subject line that will stand out in their inbox and actually get clicked. Assess your attendee demographics and research what kinds of content they consume. Are they a younger generation who appeals to a more friendly, fun tone of voice? Or are they industry professionals who\u2019d resonate with a more business-casual tone in your writing? These are just a few examples of how knowing your audience can reflect in your choice of writing style. The more you tailor your message to resonate with your attendees, the more likely they are to open your email!\n\n\n\n5 tips on writing catchy email subject lines\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into our curated list of event subject line examples, let\u2019s go over a few general tips that you can apply when creating your subject line.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Keep it short&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe know you want to delve into your event details so your recipient knows exactly why it\u2019s a must-attend event, but don\u2019t jump too far ahead! Keep your subject line short and sweet, ideally between 7-9 words or about 60 characters. This way, mobile users can read the full line without anything being cut off. You'll pack a punch, leaving your reader wanting to open for more! Your subject line should give enough information so your recipient knows what the email is about without being too lengthy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Avoid spam words\n\n\n\nOne of the best things you can do as you put together your event email campaign is to research how to avoid email spam filters. A spam filter is designed to keep unwanted or dangerous emails out of a recipient's inbox, and we need to make sure your event invitation email doesn\u2019t get mistaken for one! There are many types of spam trigger words to be aware of like \u201c100% Free\u201d or \u201cAct Now\u201d. This is because they are either exaggerated promises or pushing a questionable sense of urgency. To work around this if you\u2019re still looking to create a sense of urgency, try using a phrase like \u201cLimited Time Offer\u201d instead of \u201cAct Now\u201d. As long as you remain responsible with these words, you\u2019ll be just fine! If you\u2019re unsure whether your subject line is up to par, check out a subject line tester. This will let you know if your subject line is an optimal length and help you avoid using any negative words.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Stir the emotions with your subject lines\n\n\n\nWhat emotion do you want to evoke in your recipient? Perhaps a fear of missing out? How about excitement? According to Zippia, emotional content is 94% more effective than rational content. Rather than just stating that your event is coming up, briefly capture how awesome the experience is going to be with some powerful adjectives to pique readers\u2019 interest. You could also mention phrases like \u201cTickets Are Selling Fast!\u201d in your subject line to get your potential attendees in on the action before your event sells out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Utilize emojis and numbers\n\n\n\nEmojis are a super fun and powerful way to level up your event subject line! In fact, 56% of brands that utilize emojis in their subject lines have higher open rates! Be sure to use them sparingly (finding the one perfect emoji is the way to go!) and not give an emoji overload. Similarly, try incorporating a number in your subject. This could be anything from an event statistic like how many people attended your last event to another metric you\u2019re proud to show off like the number of special guests in your conference lineup or the amount your nonprofit has fundraised already.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Implement A\/B testing&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you really want to see which subject lines work, try using A\/B testing. This is a sure way to gain insight into what types of subject lines lead to higher open rates with your audience. To conduct an A\/B test, you create two subject lines and deliver one line to a portion of your email list while sending the other line to the rest. Tools like Constant Contact offer A\/B testing so you can be more intentional to use subject lines that lead to higher open rates. This works for post-event thank-you emails as well, in case you want to find the best subject lines for trying to collect feedback after your event!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 ideas for event email subject lines\n\n\n\nTime for the star of the show!

Now it\u2019s time for the fun part: creating a great event landing page and getting those tickets live and ready to sell. Your customers\u2019 first impression of your event page can make or break their decision to follow through with their purchase, so you want to take extra care to build it the right way. What makes for the perfect event page design, you might be wondering? We\u2019re glad you asked! As you build your page on TicketLeap and get more eyes on your event listing, follow these tips and check out our event landing page examples to help you sell more tickets.\n\n\n\nHow do I create an event landing page?\n\n\n\nIt's easy! Simply sign up for a TicketLeap account, give us your basic event information, and you're ready for lift off. Once you have logged into your account, click on the \"Create Event\" button and fill in all your important event details such as its name, event date, start and end times, and location. You can add in venues or pull a saved location from previous events on your page. Be sure to add a few types of event categories too so potential attendees in your target audience are able to more easily find it. Add your event's capacity and select from various ticket types (free, paid, and pay-what-you-want) to further build out your unique landing page. From there, it's a matter of inserting all your key details and encouraging visitors to buy their tickets!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes good event landing pages?\n\n\n\nOnce you've got all the essential elements added in, now it's time to flesh everything out with our helpful tips for creating a successful event landing page!\n\n\n\n1. Use attention-grabbing images &amp; videos\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the first thing that immediately captures visitors' attention on your event page? Your header image! Use this space as an opportunity to give a snapshot into your event. The more exciting the image, the more interested your audience will be (and more likely to purchase tickets). Showcase attendees having a blast at a past event, a notable guest sharing a laugh with the audience, or a branded graphic that showcases your lineup of performances and activities. Plus, on top of your main image, TicketLeap makes it easy to add other photos alongside your event description, so you can show off a highlight reel of everything you have to offer. You can also embed videos to truly showcase your events and persuade more potential attendees to buy their tickets. And remember, make sure all your images are high resolution \u2013 the clearer, the better. By doing some simple editing, using a tripod, and testing different camera angles, you can really bolster your event photography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Put your description to good use\n\n\n\nThis is the heart of your event listing, so make it count! Lead with a hook to get customers interested and highlight the most interesting key details of your event. Include what you\u2019re doing, how you\u2019re doing it, and what your attendees will get out of it. Your event description should be the place where you're educating potential customers on what they're going to get from you and convincing them they need to see it for themselves! To make the biggest impact, discuss only the most exciting aspects of your festivities. Use the dynamic formatting like headers, bulleted lists, bold text, and italics to create event landing pages that are easy to catch all your key event details at a glance. You could even add in some testimonials from previous event attendees or a brief bio to build social proof. If someone\u2019s on your page, they\u2019re already interested in what you have to offer, so give them the highlights and then stand back to let them buy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Level up your event page with more features\n\n\n\nTo build the best event landing page possible, you need to make the most of all the features TicketLeap has to offer. For example, if you\u2019re hosting multiple dates at your event, showcase all your dates at once with an event calendar directly on your listing. Offer multiple ticket types (general admission, VIP, senior discount, etc.) for a single event to cater to multiple audiences and bring in more money. At checkout, include a questionnaire to gain more insights on your attendees or a waiver for your event attendees to sign (this is especially if you're hosting a haunted attraction!). Finally, add your finishing touches to match your branding on your page's background, your call to action buttons, and more. You should even consider selling add-ons like exclusive merchandise and parking passes, to pad your bottom line and give your attendees an even better event experience.\n\n\n\n4. Double up for mobile\n\n\n\nDid you know that over 60% of the traffic to your event page is likely from a mobile device? If most of your audience is visiting your event listing from their phones, it\u2019s vital that your page looks great on any mobile or desktop device. TicketLeap has already done all the heavy lifting for you to make sure your ticketing page is mobile-friendly, so all you need to do is double check that you like how your images are cropped and how your event description is formatted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Make it easy to contact you\n\n\n\nSometimes, your more curious potential buyers will need a few more details before sealing the deal. In these cases, make it as easy as possible for them to talk to your team directly and get quick answers. Including an email address on your TicketLeap event listing shows that you\u2019re willing to go the extra mile for them. You should also include links to your social media accounts within your landing page so they can check out even more of your event and stay up-to-date as your event gets closer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Share, share, share!\n\n\n\nThe best way to get people onto your event landing page is with eye-catching marketing campaigns that stop them in their tracks. That means sharing your TicketLeap event listing everywhere \u2013 in your social media bios, on your event\u2019s website, on social posts, in emails, as QR codes on flyers, and anywhere else you can think of! With TicketLeap, you'll already have a QR code automatically generated for you to help raise event awareness. On top of being where you sell tickets, think of this as a landing page for event promotion as well! As people start talking more about your event and recommending it to their friends, your listing will be ready and easy for them to share, getting more people excited about your event and eager to buy tickets.\n\n\n\nAdditional event landing page examples\n\n\n\nTo help you get the ball rolling, here's a few event landing page examples to help you in your event planning!\n\n\n\nExample 1: Music event\n\n\n\nThis dedicated event landing page is a great example of capturing all the details of what to expect from your upcoming event and encouraging visitors to get their tickets! It's welcoming and to the point, with a sleek and well branded event page design that drives people to your call to action button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Theater company\n\n\n\nThis event landing page uses an embedded video to really capture people's attention, incorporates a testimonial in bold text to add social proof, and lays out all the important event details for potential attendees without getting too in the weeds. The branding of this page perfectly matches the spooky tone of this event as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Art workshop\n\n\n\nThis meticulously crafted landing page uses a vibrant photo to really make the page pop! As an event marketer, you want your pages to be drawn in from first glance not just in what you say, but in how it looks. This web page also lays out all of the details in an easy-to-scan way by using headers, bullet points, and even some emojis!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\n\nNow, it's time to build your own event landing page! With TicketLeap by your side, you\u2019ll be fully equipped to build the best event landing page possible for all your upcoming events. Now, let your creative juices flow as you master the art of crafting a high converting event landing page, then watch those ticket sales roll in!\n","date":"22 Mar 2024","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/concert-packed-with-people-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":86,"name":"Event Listing","slug":"event-listing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":86,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Building a captivating website and ticketing page are essential to selling more tickets to your events!

Now, as you think about buying your tickets, make sure to purchase from the event's official ticketing provider if at all possible. However, in certain instances, you may want to buy resale tickets. If that's the case, you'll want to take extra precaution to avoid the risk of ticket scams. Check out our tips on how to not get scammed buying tickets!\n\n\n\nWhat are ticket scams?\n\n\n\nTicket scams are unfortunately prevalent in today's world. According to the&nbsp;Better Business Bureau, thousands of unsuspecting individuals fall victim to these fraudulent schemes each year. Ticket scams involve dishonest individuals or organizations selling counterfeit or invalid tickets to unsuspecting buyers. Targeting tickets that are in high demand or are sold out, these scams are especially popular with events such as concerts, sports games, and plays. Fraudsters see a demand for tickets (like at a sold-out show) and entice people with a chance to finally go to the event. Due to their prevalence, it's all the more important that you take steps to avoid this fraud, with a trusted ticketing platform like TicketLeap by your side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do ticket scams work?\n\n\n\nOver the years, there have been different types of scams, from fake concert ticket scams to illegal resales. To help you know how to avoid ticket scams, it's important to identify ways that these schemes are typically carried out:\n\n\n\n\nFake tickets:&nbsp;Fraudsters will sell counterfeit tickets, either printed or digital, that are made to look exactly like the event's tickets but won't work when scanned.\n\n\n\nWrong seats: You'll be charged for a seat that the fraudster hasn't secured yet, then buy a cheaper seat for you after they've been paid and take the extra profit.\n\n\n\nDuplicate tickets: The same ticket will be sold to multiple people, so the first person to scan the ticket will be admitted while the others will unfortunately be turned away.\n\n\n\nSocial media scams:&nbsp;Phishing accounts will either reach out to sell you fake tickets on social media, or they'll create fake social media ads that link to fraudulent sites that sell invalid tickets.\n\n\n\nFake event website:&nbsp;On a fraudulent site, an error message will pop up after your purchase asking for you to submit your bank information again, thus charging you twice. A fraudster may also make a website similar to the event in order to capture login information and use that to steal that person's ticket purchase(s) from the actual site.\n\n\n\nIllegal resale:&nbsp;Fraudsters will use a stolen credit card to purchase tickets and then resell them for profit.\n\n\n\n\nHow to safeguard from ticket scams\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to avoiding ticket scams, your best line of defense is you! Here are some key steps on how to not get scammed buying tickets:\n\n\n\nResearch the event\n\n\n\nYour first resort should always be to go straight to the event itself to buy your tickets. That said, you'll want to do some extra investigating to determine if the event is reputable and if they're selling tickets through a secure ticketing platform. Check out third-party sites (like social media and news articles) and read reviews to find out what past attendees have said about the event.\n\n\n\nIf you're considering purchasing resale tickets, ask yourself, \u201cDoes this event explicitly say they allow ticket reselling or not?\u201d Check the event's website regarding their policy on this, or reach out to them directly to clarify. You may also want to see if people have successfully bought resold tickets there before. If the event doesn't allow ticket resale, you know to only buy tickets from the event itself!\n\n\n\nPurchase through official box offices and promoters only\n\n\n\nThe best way to avoid ticket scams is to purchase your tickets directly from the source (aka, the event!). Whether you buy directly on their website or through a third-party event listing, check that they're using a secure, reputable ticketing platform \u2013 like&nbsp;TicketLeap! If you want to be extra sure, you can contact TicketLeap's&nbsp;support team&nbsp;to confirm before purchasing your tickets.\n\n\n\nIf you search the event online, don't assume the first few sites in the search results are legitimate. There's a chance they're not the official website and could sell fake tickets. Therefore,&nbsp;always triple check that you're purchasing through the event's official website and their verified ticketing provider. Not only will you ensure your tickets are valid, you'll also get the best prices that way too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to safely buy resale tickets from a third-party vendor\n\n\n\nShould you need to\u00a0purchase resale tickets, the safest way is through verified ticket resellers. When doing so, stick to brands you trust like\u00a0SeatGeek\u00a0or\u00a0StubHub. However, an important disclaimer with resale tickets, there's always an outside chance they're not authentic tickets, so always prioritize buying from the official source. That said, here's a few factors to help confirm that you're purchasing from a legit third-party vendor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck seller reviews\n\n\n\nTo safeguard from unauthorized third-party sellers, don't automatically trust the links that appear in search results. Though being at the top of search results may make them seem trustworthy, these links could be fraudulent like fake paid ads or tickets being sold with super high fees. So, take caution and do some extra digging \u2013 it's worth it!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVerify the legitimacy of the seller by checking their reviews online. Pay close attention to any reviews with negative terms in them such as \u201cfake\u201d, \u201cfraud\u201d, or \u201cscam\u201d (both related to this event if available and others on the resellers' site). As for how to verify tickets are real, you should confirm the vendor's contact information (phone number, email address, etc.) as well as look for security features such as a secure checkout system and customer service policies. Check what the prices typically are too. Avoid tickets with major discounts compared to their normal prices directly from the event.\" Ultimately, your vigilance will help protect you from potential scams so you can buy your tickets with confidence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriple-check the time and location of your tickets\n\n\n\nEven if the seller is legitimate, it can be easy to buy tickets for the wrong time and location \u2013 so, be careful! People often buy the incorrect dates or cities of resellers because it isn't 100% clear. So when purchasing tickets, make sure to double-check the dates, times, and locations of your tickets before you click \u201cbuy\u201d.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead ticket guarantees and refund policies\n\n\n\nTo confidently buy resale tickets, use a reseller that has a crystal clear refund policy. In their refund policy, ensure there's a clear and explicit statement that you'll receive valid tickets or you'll get your money back. In case the unexpected happens, confirm what the reseller's policy is regarding event cancellations or rescheduling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnly purchase through verified resellers with a credit card\n\n\n\nWhen making purchases, it's highly recommended to use a verified seller and avoid peer-to-peer payment methods like Zelle, Cash App, and Venmo. What are verified resale tickets exactly? They are the safest way to buy tickets outside of the event's ticketing provider. To protect yourself when buying tickets, research what third-party resellers the event's ticketing platform endorses. You can also refer to additional resources like the members of the&nbsp;National Association of Ticket Brokers&nbsp;(NATB), associated with the Better Business Bureau.\n\n\n\nIf you do use a peer-to-peer payment service (like purchasing tickets from a mutual friend), be sure to utilize purchase protection services like PayPal Goods and Services. Moreover, it's advised to&nbsp;always&nbsp;use a credit card for an extra layer of safety. That way, in the instance where it is fraud, you can dispute the charge with your credit card company and keep your bank account protected. Remember, it's absolutely vital to be 100% sure the tickets are real before buying them!\n\n\n\nLooking to buy from a person? How to avoid ticket scammers\n\n\n\nWe strongly recommend people prioritize purchasing tickets directly from the event's official website, then looking into verified ticket resale platforms if tickets are no longer available on the website. Buying from individuals should be one's last resort, and only done with people you trust. That said, here are some tips on how to not get scammed buying tickets, including red flags to look out for.\n\n\n\nStick to people you know\n\n\n\nShould you choose to buy from an individual, it's best to stick with people you know personally - like mutual friends or coworkers. Even in these instances though, ask to see the tickets before buying them, so you can verify they're real tickets and that they didn't accidentally purchase invalid tickets from a reseller.\n\n\n\nDouble-check ticket details\n\n\n\nCurious how to tell if tickets are fake? To start off, ask for the ticket purchaser to send you their original ticket purchase confirmation via email or in person. It's important to receive this receipt via email so they don't create a fake one and you can verify that the email address from the vendor (like StubHub or Ticketmaster) is legit. Fake \u201cFrom\u201d emails (like help-ticketmaster.com or ticket-master.com) are a clear sign of fake tickets. Fraudulent tickets could be for seats that don't exist in the venue. If you're unsure, feel free to call the venue itself to confirm. If you meet in person to see the tickets, ensure you meet in a public place with lots of people around.\n\n\n\nEven if the resold ticket looks legitimate, someone may have replicated it, which means purchasing through a third party cannot be 100% verified. The only foolproof way to know if tickets are authentic is to purchase them directly through the event's ticketing provider or their box office yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeware of too-good-to-be-true deals\n\n\n\nIf a seller is pressuring you to make a quick purchase, that's a huge red flag. Take your time and trust your instincts. Remember, if someone approaches&nbsp;you&nbsp;about their tickets, it's likely a fraud attempt. Do your research on what the ticket price is, because if these tickets are overpriced or heavily discounted, it could be a sign that they're not legitimate.\n\n\n\nSpot suspicious payment methods\n\n\n\nWhen paying for tickets,&nbsp;never&nbsp;wire the money or purchase with a prepaid money card. If you do use a peer-to-peer payment processor, use a purchase protection policy, ensuring you're eligible for a refund if the tickets are fake. By sticking to these precautions, you can shield yourself from fraudulent ticket sales and enjoy your event!\n\n\n\nLook out for online marketplaces and social media\n\n\n\nBe wary of online marketplaces like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. To verify the seller, you'll need to do some digging on their profile to ensure they're an actual person and not impersonating a fan or using a hacked account. Some telltale signs of illegitimate sellers are a super low follower count and generic images on their account.\n\n\n\nAs we mentioned previously, another way people can try to scam you is through fake event ads. If you see a social media ad for an awesome event, pull up the event's website in your browser to avoid the risk of clicking into a fake ad. This simple step can help you navigate how to avoid ticket scams!\n\n\n\nAlready bought a fake ticket? Here's what to do\n\n\n\nShould you discover that you've purchased a fraudulent ticket, contact your bank and your credit card company immediately. By reporting the ticket fraud to your credit card company, they'll help&nbsp;dispute the charge&nbsp;(if not stop it altogether!). It's also important to file a local police report, especially if you had any in-person interaction with the scammer. Additionally, reach out to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding the incident, and consider sharing your experience on the Better Business Bureau Scam Tracker to help others avoid similar ticket scams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere you have it! When it comes to buying tickets, it's important to know how to verify tickets are real to ensure everything goes smoothly on event day. Remember to always purchase through the actual event and their official ticket provider (like TicketLeap!), and avoid third-party vendors unless absolutely necessary. Should you purchase resale tickets, exercise extreme caution with the help of these tips.

Now, it's time to send a thoughtful post-event email that shares your gratitude to each attendee. However, considering the average person receives over 100 emails per day, it's important to ensure that the thank-you message after attending your event stands out from the crowd. Here's how to craft an irresistible email that'll make your attendees feel super appreciated!\n\n\n\nWhy a post-event thank-you email matters\n\n\n\nYour attendees took the time to come out to your event and had a memorable time with their friends and family in the process. A heartfelt thank-you email after your event not only shows your genuine appreciation but also reiterates how valuable it was for them to attend in the first place. It builds their trust, thus making them excited to come back to your next one! When done right, these emails are vital to your&nbsp;event marketing strategy&nbsp;because of how they help retain existing attendees. Plus, add a survey to this email, and you'll be able to gain valuable feedback on how you can improve your future events!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey elements to include in your post-event thank-you email\n\n\n\nEager to spread the love? Let's dive into the essential elements that make up effective event follow-up emails.\n\n\n\n1. Subject line\n\n\n\nYour subject line is your first impression \u2013 so make it count! To start, keep it concise and compelling at around 9 words or 60 characters. Remember, the goal of a clear subject line is to grab your recipient's attention and make them eager to open your email.\n\n\n\nConsider adding emojis for an extra touch of excitement and warmth. Don't shy away from question marks or exclamation marks as they can convey enthusiasm or peak curiosity. And if you want to spice things up, think about incentivizing your readers with a sneak peek or exclusive offer if they fill out your post-event survey. Here's a few examples of some email subject lines:\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Want a Free Ticket to Our Next Event? (Fill Out Our Survey!)\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Cheers to Harmony Fest! \ud83c\udfb6 Thanks for the Magic!\"\n\n\n\n\"Kudos from CharityRun! \ud83c\udf1f Your Presence Shined Bright!\"\n\n\n\n\" \ud83c\udf20 We're Grateful for Your Support at Unity Gala!\"\n\n\n\n\"Epic Moments at DreamQuest! \ud83d\ude80 Thank You, Trailblazers!\"\n\n\n\n\n2. Personalized greeting\n\n\n\nA personalized greeting is powerful! Addressing recipients by their name, referring to the specific event they attended, or even acknowledging their continuous support (if they're regular event attendees), all make your event-goers feel seen and valued. A good example of this could be \"John, Thanks for Helping Make Our Event a Success!\" or \"Thank You for Making Our Fall Event Unforgettable, Sarah!\"\n\n\n\n3. Email body\n\n\n\nThis is the bulk of your email where you'll want to go into more detail to fully express your gratitude. To help get you started, we've included a few more important pieces you may want to mix and match in your email's body paragraphs.\n\n\n\nShowing gratitude&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExpress your thanks sincerely, acknowledging their contribution to the event's success. Opt for a genuine, heartfelt tone and go into detail about the ways that people helped make this event an unforgettable one. Sharing specific stories or examples could go a long way towards truly capturing how much you appreciate your attendees.\n\n\n\nEvent highlights&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen selecting the right specific highlights to share, consider moments that were the most impactful for attendees. These memorable moments might include videos or&nbsp;event images&nbsp;of standing ovations, surprise moments, or even lively speaking sessions. Be sure to include any measurable outcomes your event might have reached. Did you exceed your fundraising goal? Did your event sell out? Let your attendees know about their incredible impact!\n\n\n\nTestimonials&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSharing quotes and testimonials from attendees can also paint a vivid picture of the event. To gather these testimonials, you could ask attendees during the event about their favorite moments or check if attendees left any meaningful comments on social media that you could highlight (with their permission, of course!). And if your event has a specific cause like a&nbsp;charity fundraiser, reach out to the people that your event is impacting! Hearing direct accounts from the community benefiting from your event will motivate your attendees to continue lending a helping hand!\n\n\n\nVideo clips of your team's thanks&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncorporating a short video clip into your post-event thank-you email adds a dynamic and personal touch. In your video, you can edit clips of your team expressing their gratitude to those who attended! You could also provide a visual recap of your event's highlights, capturing the energy from your event that words alone might struggle to fully convey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Call to action\n\n\n\nYour thank-you participation email should end with a clear call to action (CTA) that'll encourage your readers to take the next step. You typically want one primary CTA and possibly a secondary one, but that's all! Your goal is to direct as many people to completing your CTA as possible. Here are a few ideas of what that could be.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nFill out a survey&nbsp;\u2013 Encourage feedback to show attendees that their opinion matters.\n\n\n\nFollow you on social media&nbsp;- Keep the connection going and boost your social media presence by directing them to your various accounts on&nbsp;Instagram, Facebook, etc.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReserve tickets to upcoming events&nbsp;- Give a sneak peek into other upcoming events and link to where they can secure their tickets.\n\n\n\nWatch a video&nbsp;\u2013 Captivate your readers with a video that'll express your thanks beyond just words!\n\n\n\nSign up for your newsletter&nbsp;- Make sure your attendees are signed up to stay up-to-date with all your latest event news.\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the CTA you choose, you may have the link as a large, bold-colored button near the top or bottom of your email with a short, imperative phrase like \u201cSign Up Now!\u201d or \u201cGet Your Tickets Today!\u201d You may also embed the video or survey form inside your email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Design&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, we've gone through how to write a post-event thank-you email, but what should it look like? A well-designed email is just as important as the words themselves. Opt for a clean and organized layout, making it engaging and easy to read at a glance. And when it comes to visuals, ensure the font and color scheme match your event's branding to drive increased trust with your brand identity. With an aesthetically pleasing email design, your appreciation will be communicated much more effectively!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. CCPA compliance portion\n\n\n\nOne last thing! When it comes to email marketing, it's essential to respect your recipients' privacy. For organizations operating within the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) sets important legal rules for marketers to abide by. The CCPA gives customers the right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared. When crafting your post-event thank-you email templates, ensure you're compliant with the CCPA by being transparent, offering an opt-out option, and having a system in place for data deletion requests.\n\n\n\nDon't forget to thank your team\n\n\n\nFollow-up emails are more than just for your event's attendees! Think about all the moving parts of your event and who helped in making it a success. This could include&nbsp;event sponsors, vendors, speakers, volunteers, and staff. It's important that you express your sincere gratitude to them too for bringing your awesome event to life! By incorporating post-event thank-you emails to these groups in your&nbsp;post-event game plan, you'll cultivate those relationships and excite them to continue working with you in the future. To go even a step further, you could branch out from email and send them a handwritten thank-you note as a small token of your appreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen is the best time to hit send after a successful event?\n\n\n\nChoosing the right time to send your post-event thank-you email is as crucial as its content. After all, you'll want to make every email count! Typically, the optimal time to send your thank-you email is within 24 to 48 hours after the event. This is when their experience is still fresh in your attendees' minds, meaning they're more likely to engage with your email and provide valuable feedback. To help, certain email marketing platforms can determine the ideal send time for the best possible open rates (in general though, it's suggested that 10am and 2pm are prime times for engagement). This way, your thank-you email will not only be heartfelt and engaging, but adequately timed too.\n\n\n\nTracking and measuring success\n\n\n\nThe success of your post-event thank-you email can be measured through a few&nbsp;key analytics. With the following metrics, you can fine-tune your thank-you emails for future events!\n\n\n\nOpen rates&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOpen rates measure how many people click into your email from their inbox. Higher open rates mean your subject line was effective at capturing people's attention and making them eager to read more. According to a&nbsp;Mailerlite study, the target open rate for events is around 36.16%. To help increase your open rates, consider trying the following tips:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nConduct an A\/B test using various subject line variations.\n\n\n\nIncorporate an enticing&nbsp;email preheader&nbsp;that provides recipients with a compelling reason to open.\n\n\n\n\nClick-through rates\n\n\n\nClick-through rates measure how many readers clicked the content within your email (like a video, a CTA button, or links to your socials). Looking at this metric shows whether your content and call to action were compelling enough for readers to take an action. According to the same Mailerlite study as above, the benchmark click-through rate for events is 6.63%. Feel free to try the following tips to improve your click-through rates:\n\n\n\n\nDivide subscribers into more targeted and meaningful segments.\n\n\n\nProvide more enticing incentives to encourage people to click.\n\n\n\nConduct A\/B testing on various email scripts to determine which ones connect better with your audience.\n\n\n\nInclude links to blog posts, surveys, quizzes, or any other valuable content for your audience.\n\n\n\n\nEmail responses\n\n\n\nPeople's responses to your email, particularly by filling out your survey, are great ways to gain insight. In addition to direct feedback, look at any replies to your email, comments on your videos, and anywhere else attendees might share their thoughts about your event. These responses can help you understand what resonated with them the most and what aspects of the event should be improved in the future.\n\n\n\nSample thank-you email templates\n\n\n\nWe've created a few post-event thank-you email examples for different event types with a mixture of various CTAs.

Well, you're in the right place! We'll be sharing some tips and tricks on how to create awesome events that not only impress your attendees but also help protect our planet. From using LED lightbulbs to upcycling decorations, these best practices will give you fresh, creative ways to make your events more sustainable.\n\n\n\nWhat is a sustainable event?\n\n\n\nA sustainable event is one that's organized in a responsible way, leaving a positive impact on the environment and reducing any negative effects. Nowadays, sustainable events are becoming increasingly popular, as people become more aware of the need to protect our planet and our communities. That's why it's crucial to incorporate eco-friendly event planning as much as possible into the various aspects of your event, from your venue choice to your final decorations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBenefits of sustainable event planning&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy utilizing sustainable&nbsp;event planning&nbsp;strategies, not only will you be contributing to a healthier planet and society, but you'll also be saving money on expenses like electricity bills and disposable items. Since many event-goers appreciate events that prioritize sustainability, you'll enhance your reputation and&nbsp;attract more attendees. And on top of all that, you'll feel more accomplished knowing that you're doing your part in promoting social responsibility.\n\n\n\n7 practical ways to make your event more sustainable\n\n\n\nNow that we've covered the fundamentals of sustainability, let's discuss how you can put them into action!\n\n\n\n1. Select a green venue&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen looking for a venue, keep an eye out for places with green certifications or that offer recycling and composting services. Green certifications like&nbsp;LEED&nbsp;or&nbsp;Green Globe&nbsp;show that a venue has taken steps to reduce its environmental impact, making it a considerable choice to practice event sustainability. By choosing a green venue, you're showing your attendees that you care about sustainability, and they'll be more likely to support your events in the future.\n\n\n\n2. Upcycle materials\n\n\n\nUpcycling is a creative way to turn old or discarded items into something new and useful. For example, you can use old jars or wine bottles to create unique centerpieces or planters that will add a touch of charm to your event, like using jars as vases for your flower bouquets. Consider using recycled materials (like reusable fabric or recycled plastic) for your swag bags. As for decorations, refurbished pallets or doors can make cool, rustic backdrops that will impress your guests. As a more specific example, if you're hosting fall events on a farm, try transforming leftover wooden pallets or bales of hay into benches. By upcycling materials, you'll be promoting sustainability, while adding a unique touch to your event.\n\n\n\n3. Practice waste management&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThink classy \u2013 never trashy! Start by opting for reusable types of plates, cutlery, and cups instead of disposable ones. If you do need to use disposable items, choose ones that are compostable or made from recycled materials. Also, if the venue you selected doesn't already offer recycling services, consider setting up some recycling and composting bins around the venue yourself and encourage attendees to use them. Once your event wraps up, consider donating any leftover food to a local food pantry if possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Go paperless\n\n\n\nGoing paperless is an excellent start to eco-friendly event planning. With a&nbsp;ticketing platform&nbsp;like TicketLeap, you'll reduce your paper usage by taking advantage of digital tools like event management software,&nbsp;online registration, and mobile ticketing. Then, during the event itself, you can replace paper programs and agendas with digital versions so attendees can quickly scan a QR code or click a link to access them on their phones. By going paperless, you'll both reduce waste but save money on printing costs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Cater local seasonal foods&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPlan your menu around what's in season and purchase your food from local farmers or suppliers to help reduce your carbon footprint. By doing so, you'll be both supporting local businesses and decreasing how far your food has to travel to your event. Since seasonal foods are those grown and harvested during a particular season, they'll be fresher, tastier, and require fewer resources to transport. Trust us, your guests will go bananas for how delicious and fresh your locally-sourced food is!\n\n\n\n6. Find eco-friendly ways of transportation&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRather than drive in separate cars, encourage your attendees to carpool or use public transportation. On top of helping reduce traffic and air pollution, you'll also promote a sense of community and shared responsibility for the environment. To make it easier for your attendees to use public transportation as an option, consider providing shuttle services to your\u00a0event venue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n7. Minimize energy usage&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy taking even just simple measures, you can significantly reduce your event's energy consumption and support a greener world. For instance, if your event is during the day, open up windows and doors to let in natural sunlight rather than rely on artificial lighting. When you need extra lighting though (like for nighttime events), use energy-efficient bulbs whenever possible since LED lights use up to&nbsp;90% less energy&nbsp;than traditional incandescent bulbs. And be sure to turn off lights whenever they're not in use! You can also save energy by turning off equipment when it's not needed, like projectors, sound systems, and other electronics.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGreen event planning typically looks like small changes that make big differences. Try some of these tips yourself, and fill your attendees in on your efforts to host sustainable events too. As you work to reduce waste and conserve your resources, you'll inspire others to follow your lead. Together we can make a positive impact on the world around us, one small step at a time!\n","date":"7 Nov 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64821d93c06925dbc95661ae_hands-holding-plant-sapling-scaled-1-1024x481.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

Organizing and planning an event is nothing short of a hefty task, which is why we're here to break down the first steps in successful event organization. When looking for how to plan an event, use these steps and you'll lay a strong, secure foundation for the event of a lifetime.\n\n\n\nLay out your vision\n\n\n\nIf you're planning an event, there's probably a good reason for doing so (and if you're just doing it for fun, we want to be your friend). Events are time-consuming and can be expensive, so it's important to know exactly what you're trying to accomplish at your event. That's why the first step in the event planning process is laying out your goals and objectives. Is your event a fundraiser? A product launch? A celebration of a milestone or corporate success? Pick a mission and event theme before entering your planning stage and ask yourself along the way, \u201cHow does this aspect of my event help further my objectives?\u201d\n\n\n\nAll event planning starts with a spark\u200d\n\n\n\nOnce you know what your event is setting out to accomplish, it's time to evaluate who will be attending (aka, who\u2019s your target audience) and what your revenue goals are. These two aspects are extremely interdependent. Not only is the rest of your planning dependent on being able to accommodate the number of attendees, but you need to define financial goals that these attendees will bring in. With this, it's important to keep in mind the value of your event: is $200 for a ticket a reasonable price, or will your audience not want to pay that much? For example, assume that your sweet spot for attendees is 250 guests. At 250 guests, your venue rental will not be too expensive and will leave greater profit margins. However, needing to accommodate 350 guests might force you to rent a more expensive venue and may lower the profit margins on ticket sales. Once you have a general idea of your goals and objectives, you'll begin to get your creative wheels turning on how your event plan will be executed.\n\n\n\nOrganize a successful event with a reasonable event budget\n\n\n\nBefore planning can begin, it's important to set a realistic event budget during your organizational stages. While some aspects of budget-setting may seem obvious--like venue rental, food, and entertainment--there are aspects of event planning that aren't so clear. You'll need to consider how much you want to spend on marketing, security and personnel, audio and video, and any technology you'll need to keep your event running smoothly. An event planning checklist will be helpful to make sure all these factors are checked off!Luckily, ticketing and event management software can help manage your event budget and drive revenue. Ticketing platforms not only disperse and sell tickets for your event but allow you to create a custom listing for your event. Using this event listing, you can begin promotional efforts for a fraction of the price and event marketing. Additionally, a ticketing platform allows you to manage onsite ticket sales and utilize promotional tools, helping you stay within your budget and maximize the bang for your buck.\n\n\n\nNail down your time and place before you start preparations\n\n\n\nAlmost all of your event management planning will revolve around the time and place of your event. Preparations involving caterers and entertainment, for example, cannot be completed until you can supply a date and location for booking purposes. When choosing your venue and date, there are a variety of factors you need to consider:\n\n\n\nShould I prioritize the date or the venue?\n\n\n\nBe prepared to play a game of give and take if your event must be at either a specific place or on a specific date. You can avoid this by beginning your event planning as far in advance as possible.\n\n\n\nHow will guests arrive?\n\n\n\nIf your event attracts guests from far away, it's important to consider whether access to transportation, parking, and overnight accommodations will be a factor in choosing your event space.\n\n\n\nIs my event near a holiday?\n\n\n\nThough it may seem obvious, be sure that you choose a date that doesn't conflict with major holidays that could prevent your attendees from buying a ticket.\n\n\n\nPartner with other brands to expand your audience\n\n\n\nThere are a wide variety of benefits to finding partners and sponsors for your event. Big brands love to get their names on the hottest events and are often willing to shell out tens of thousands of dollars to get in on the action of your event marketing. \u200dTo find sponsors and partners, there are two main things to keep in mind: act early and act with intention. The whole point of a partner or sponsorship is that it lessens the financial risk of your company alone. However, many large companies plan financial sponsorships at the beginning of a fiscal year, so event planners need to act early in finding sponsorships. Additionally, it's important to be intentional when choosing your partners. Be sure that the brand's mission is aligned with yours. This not only ensures that the even is beneficial for all partners involved, but can help foster opportunities for ongoing event promotion partnerships.Organizing and planning an event can seem daunting at first.

In this guide, we'll dive into the essential steps for planning and executing a successful fundraising event for your nonprofit organization. Now, let's get ready to embark on a journey that'll empower your team to make a bigger impact on the world!\n\n\n\n1. Establish your nonprofit's fundraising purpose\n\n\n\nA nonprofit event's success hinges on establishing a clear purpose. After all, the event's objectives will serve as the foundation for your promotional strategy, which in turn will guide your decision-making to raise money and attract supporters. Start by asking yourself&nbsp;important questions about your fundraiser&nbsp;like what target audience you hope to resonate with or what ways you want to build a buzz for your cause. By incorporating this knowledge into your strategies, you'll be well on your way to creating a charity event that resonates with that audience and helps raise awareness.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you're organizing a flag football tournament to raise awareness for a children's hospital and collect donations, consider additional efforts like a raffle to boost excitement and encourage people to donate, even if they aren't sports fans. Additionally, incorporating peer-to-peer fundraising strategies (such as having participants set up fundraising webpages and asking for donations ahead of time) can help increase engagement and your overall fundraising success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying your event objectives\n\n\n\nWhether your aim is to inspire people to take action, reach a new audience, or grow your nonprofit, having clear objectives will guide your decision-making throughout the&nbsp;event planning process.\n\n\n\nYou'll want these event objectives to be as specific and quantifiable as possible (aka,&nbsp;SMART goals). For example, rather than have your goal be something general like raise awareness for the homeless in your community, your goal could be to reach a realistic fundraising target towards building a new homeless shelter. Or, if you're raising funds for a sporting event, you should have a specific dollar amount to shoot for. That way, you'll be able to track your fundraising target alongside your donors, and use creative options to present your benchmarks like a huge thermometer or themed roadmap to show your progress.\n\n\n\nAligning your event with your nonprofit's mission\n\n\n\nTo align your event with your nonprofit's values, consider how all the activities leading up to, during, and after your event day will both engage donors and raise more money. Choose&nbsp;fundraising ideas for your event&nbsp;that resonate with your attendee demographic, like a marathon for fitness enthusiasts or a charity concert for music-lovers. You may also want to&nbsp;live stream your event&nbsp;to make it even more accessible.\n\n\n\nBy connecting your event to your mission, you'll not only create a consistent message but also draw in supporters who are passionate about your cause.\n\n\n\n2. Build a comprehensive event budget\n\n\n\nYour charity event (and reaching those fundraising goals!) is made possible with a comprehensive event budget. By mapping out your expenses and securing sponsorships, you can ensure that you're raising more money than you're spending, ultimately contributing to your event's success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping out your expenses\n\n\n\nWhen creating your event budget, you'll need to consider expenses such as:\n\n\n\n\nVenue rental\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\nMarketing materials\n\n\n\nCatering\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nUtilities\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to leave some wiggle room in your budget to account for unexpected costs, ensuring that you have enough funds to cover all your expenses. By listing all your expenses and estimating their costs, you'll have a clearer picture of the financial resources needed to host a successful fundraiser. With a thorough understanding of your expenses, you can set a fundraising goal that's both achievable and ambitious, maximizing the impact of your nonprofit.\n\n\n\nDetermining your revenue streams\n\n\n\nMapping out where your revenue will come from is the next piece that's crucial to reaching your fundraising goal. These may include:\n\n\n\n\nCharitable donations\n\n\n\nTicket sales\n\n\n\nSponsorships\n\n\n\nLive auctions\n\n\n\nSilent auctions\n\n\n\nRaffle tickets\n\n\n\nCrowdfunding\n\n\n\n\nHaving reasonable benchmarks for each revenue stream will help you determine how much money you'll put towards your ultimate fundraising goal after covering the event's expenses. This will also help you determine the&nbsp;best ticket price&nbsp;for your event for reaching your revenue goals. You can also use TicketLeap's platform to solicit additional donations!\n\n\n\nSecuring your sponsorships\n\n\n\nSeeking sponsorships&nbsp;from businesses and individuals can help cover event costs and increase your fundraising potential. By reaching out to local businesses for sponsorships, you can reduce costs and allocate more of your budget towards engaging donors and raising money for your cause. As another option, you could have multiple vendors from local restaurants onsite to show their support to your cause and offer free food to your event-goers.\n\n\n\nTo find sponsorships, start with people and businesses you know and work your way outward. Ask your board members and other people involved if they know anyone who could help, and explore companies that sponsor similar events in your area.\n\n\n\nWhen negotiating the terms of your&nbsp;sponsorship package, be prepared to explain the value of your event and be open to negotiating the terms. By securing sponsorships, you'll be one step closer to hosting an effective fundraising event.\n\n\n\n3. Create memorable experiences for your target audience\n\n\n\nPlanning a successful charity event necessitates reaching your target audience. This means you'll want to put together a lineup of activities that resonate with the people you're trying to reach. Tailoring your event experience to that audience will help you engage attendees and encourage more participation.\n\n\n\nBy selecting the right venue, theme, and lineup of entertainment, you'll create an unforgettable experience that'll leave a lasting impression on your attendees. And don't forget to showcase all these details on&nbsp;your event page&nbsp;to attract more participants too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting your venue and theme\n\n\n\nChoosing a venue\u00a0and theme that aligns with your mission and resonates with your attendees is crucial for creating a successful event. The venue and theme should be inviting and engaging, reflecting the values and goals of your nonprofit.\n\n\n\nWhen selecting a venue and theme, consider the preferences of your audience and the objectives of your event. For example, if your nonprofit focuses on environmental conservation, you could choose a local park as your venue and incorporate&nbsp;eco-friendly practices&nbsp;throughout the event. Or, if your nonprofit supports the arts, consider a community theater or somewhere with a stage for you to showcase local talent. You could also orient your charity event's theme around an upcoming holiday like Christmas, Thanksgiving or&nbsp;Halloween.\n\n\n\nYour venue is often one of your greatest costs, so choose wisely! You may consider using a space your organization already readily uses or looking into places that may donate their space in support of your next fundraising event. You'll also want to verify the accessibility of your venue to ensure it's&nbsp;more inclusive&nbsp;to all your attendees. Offering a live stream or other virtual event could expand your fundraiser's bandwidth of attendees as well. By selecting a venue and theme that resonates with your audience, you'll be more likely to attract attendees and encourage their support for your cause.\n\n\n\nIncorporating entertainment and activities\n\n\n\nPutting together an agenda jam-packed with engaging activities tailored to your audience is essential for creating a memorable event experience. By offering interactive elements, such as games, raffles, and auctions, you can encourage donations and keep attendees entertained throughout the event. Invite speakers to share motivational stories and testimonials about the work of your nonprofit. You could also incorporate musicians or local celebrities into your lineup of activities to both advocate for your cause and entertain your guests. Or, your nonprofit could organize a raffle with prizes donated by local businesses or individuals. Don't be afraid to think outside of the box!\n\n\n\n4. Recruit volunteers and staff\n\n\n\nVolunteers and staff play a vital role in your event, from assisting with registration and collecting donations to providing support and guidance to attendees. Lean on your organization's current roster of employees and volunteers for support, and assess whether you need additional help for your event. By effectively&nbsp;recruiting your staff&nbsp;and event volunteers, you'll be better equipped to handle any challenges that may arise and ensure a positive experience for all your attendees.\n\n\n\nTo help enlist volunteers, spread the word through your nonprofit's network, post on social media, and reach out to local groups and businesses. You should consider using an event registration page for volunteer candidates to sign up. Make sure to provide volunteers with a clear understanding of their responsibilities and offer training materials, videos, or webinars to help them prepare. By investing in volunteer recruitment and training, you'll be better equipped to handle any challenges that may arise during your event and ensure a successful outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinating staff responsibilities\n\n\n\nDefining staff roles and responsibilities is crucial for maintaining organization and efficiency during your event. By assigning tasks based on staff skills and experience, you can ensure that each role is filled by someone qualified and capable of doing the job.\n\n\n\nFigure out where each person's strengths and weaknesses reside, then do your best to assign them to the role that suits them the best. By effectively coordinating staff responsibilities, you can rest assured your event is set to run smoothly.\n\n\n\n5. Implement donation collection methods\n\n\n\nMaximizing your fundraising potential depends on implementing effective donation collection methods. By choosing the right platforms and encouraging donor engagement, you can increase the funds raised for your cause and create a lasting impact.\n\n\n\nChoose user-friendly donation platforms that cater to your audience's preferences and ensure secure processing, such as TicketLeap for&nbsp;online nonprofit ticketing&nbsp;or PayPal for on-the-spot payments. Make use of interactive activities and clear communication of your nonprofit's impact, which will motivate attendees to contribute to your cause and help you reach your fundraising goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right platforms\n\n\n\nSelecting the right donation platforms is crucial for ensuring a seamless and secure donation process for your attendees. User-friendly and secure platforms, such as GoFundMe, Bloomerang, or PayPal, can cater to your audience's preferences and make it easy for them to contribute to your cause.\n\n\n\nBy offering multiple donation options, you can accommodate the preferences of your target audience and make it as easy as possible to donate, so you can reach your fundraising goals even faster.\n\n\n\nEncouraging donor engagement\n\n\n\nOffering interactive activities, such as games, raffles, and auctions, can help create a fun and memorable experience for attendees while also encouraging them to contribute to your cause. In addition to interactive activities, clearly communicating the impact of your nonprofit's work can inspire donors to contribute to your cause. By sharing stories, data, and the successes of your nonprofit, you can demonstrate the results of your organization's efforts, which may motivate donors to contribute more.\n\n\n\n6. Develop your marketing strategy\n\n\n\nCreating a multi-channel&nbsp;event marketing strategy&nbsp;is essential for effectively promoting your event and attracting attendees. By utilizing digital channels such as email and social media, as well as traditional methods like flyers, direct mail, or radio ads, you can maximize your event's reach and sell more tickets to your fundraiser.\n\n\n\nTo promote your charitable events, consider the following strategies:\n\n\n\n\nTap into your nonprofit's network of friends and supporters\n\n\n\nSend out&nbsp;email invites&nbsp;to current donors\n\n\n\nPost flyers in popular venues around town\n\n\n\nEngage with local businesses for sponsorship or partnership opportunities\n\n\n\nPut out a&nbsp;press release&nbsp;and appear on local news stations to&nbsp;build publicity\n\n\n\nShare the link to your event page as much as possible! (on social media, email campaigns, websites, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can spread the word about your awesome fundraiser events!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeverage the power of social media\n\n\n\nSocial media should play a significant part of your nonprofit's marketing strategy. Create a&nbsp;Facebook event&nbsp;that you, your sponsors, and your followers can share to help spread the word. Be sure to link to your event's website or ticketing page to get the full event details and sell tickets to your fundraiser.\n\n\n\nTo encourage attendees to share your event page with their friends, host a ticket giveaway for your next event that they can enter by tagging a few people and resharing your post. Create&nbsp;short-form video content on TikTok&nbsp;and Instagram that highlights all the exciting things your charity event has to offer and how your nonprofit is impacting the community. You could also start a challenge or trend using a branded event hashtag on your posts and encourage others to do the same. If you have some extra room in your budget, you could boost event-related social media ads to your target market as well. There are plenty of unique things you can try to promote your event, so don't be afraid to try something a little out there!\n\n\n\n7. Prep for your big day\n\n\n\nAll your plans have finally come together, and now the big day is here! Get to the venue early to ensure everything is in order. Touch base with your event staff and special guests so everyone's on the same page about how the day's agenda will go. You'll want to do a test run of any sound equipment or other technology you'll be using too.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of details that go into those final moments of preparation before everyone arrives, so we've created an&nbsp;event day checklist&nbsp;to help you! Ultimately, the key to a smooth event day is extensive preparation. That way, once your charity event starts, you can enjoy it alongside your attendees!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Follow up after your fundraising event\n\n\n\nCongrats! You've successfully planned and pulled together your event. But you aren't done yet! Maintaining your relationships with those attendees, volunteers, and sponsors are dependent on conducting post-event follow-ups and evaluations. By expressing gratitude to all those who contributed to your event and measuring its success, you can ensure that your nonprofit continues to grow and thrive.\n\n\n\nEvaluating the success of your event involves measuring key performance indicators, such as the amount of funds raised, attendee satisfaction, and social media engagement. By&nbsp;analyzing these metrics, you can gain valuable insights into what worked well and what could be improved for future charity events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressing gratitude\n\n\n\nSending thank-you messages to attendees, volunteers, and sponsors is an important part of your post-event strategy. By expressing your appreciation for them you can maintain relationships with those who contributed to your event's success and foster a sense of community around your cause.\n\n\n\nPersonalized thank-you messages can help strengthen your connections with attendees, volunteers, and sponsors. By including their name, mentioning the event they attended or supported, and expressing your appreciation for their contribution, you can show your gratitude and encourage their continued involvement with your nonprofit. You should be as detailed as possible in letting attendees know how their support is helping your cause too, sharing videos and testimonials of how the money raised is impacting people in your community. That way, not only will they be glad they attended your event, you could turn them into recurring donors!\n\n\n\nMeasuring event success\n\n\n\nEvaluating key performance indicators, such as ticket sales, attendee satisfaction, and social media engagement, is a crucial part of measuring the success of your charity events. In your follow-up email, send out a survey for attendees to share what they loved about your charity event and where it can improve. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain valuable insights into what worked well and what could be improved for future charity events.\n\n\n\nApplying the results of your event evaluation to future planning can help your nonprofit to grow and thrive. By identifying areas for improvement and building on your successes, you can create even more impactful events that raise additional funds and awareness for your cause. By continually learning and adapting, your nonprofit can make a lasting difference in the world.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nThere you have it! Now you're ready to kick off your latest fundraiser and any future events you may host for your nonprofit. By following these steps and continually learning from your experiences, your nonprofit can host impactful events that raise funds and awareness for your cause.\n\n\n\nAs you embark on your journey to plan your fundraising events, TicketLeap's&nbsp;user-friendly ticketing platform&nbsp;is here to help empower your organization and your events to make a bigger impact on the world.

It's the complete foundation upon which your attendee experience unfolds. But hold on a second! Selecting an event venue is about more than aesthetics and ambiance; it's a strategic move that sets the stage for future decision-making. Think about it: picking the right venue can make or break your ticket sales, determine the rest of your budget, and influence the other factors event organizers need to juggle. So, how about we help you out? In this guide on how to find the perfect event venue, we've got step-by-step instructions, helpful tips, and plenty of inspiration to ensure that your event stands out from the crowd. Let's get started!\n\n\n\nImportance of venue selection for an event\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to\u00a0planning your event, booking the right venue is crucial. It's oftentimes your largest cost and the backbone of your events, setting the tone of your attendees' overall experience. Whether you're organizing an annual festival, a head-banging concert, a thrilling holiday party, or a heartfelt charity fundraiser, every event is unique in its own way. Thus, tailoring your venue selection to your specific event is key. Depending on its convenience, ease of parking, and other factors, your event's location can play a huge role in whether people will show up or not.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen should you start booking event venues?\n\n\n\nBooking a venue for an event depends on a few factors. First, getting the ideal date depends on your event date's flexibility. The more flexible you are with your event date, the better chance you'll have at securing a sweet deal. Second, and perhaps most importantly, it depends on the venue's general availability, especially if it's a high-demand location. Event venues often have varying rates depending on the day of the week or the season, so exploring alternative dates might just save you some money, which you can reinvest back into your event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe key here is to plan your event as far in advance as possible. By doing so, you not only increase your chances of securing that perfect date, but also you can ensure you'll get the best rates for it. Rushing into booking a venue can end up costing you more money, since last-minute availability tends to come with a premium price tag.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it's always a good idea to add buffer time before your event day for unexpected accommodations or adjustments. This way, you'll be prepared for any surprises that may arise during the planning process. So, remember to plan ahead, consider flexibility, and give yourself ample time to secure the right venue for your event. Your wallet will thank you, and your attendees will be impressed with your well-planned event.\n\n\n\nHow would you go about searching for the right venue?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to searching for event venues, it's important to utilize all your available resources. First and foremost, consider any venue options that your organization may already have. Reach out to colleagues, friends, and industry contacts in your network to see if they have any recommendations on suitable venues. This could include leveraging existing partnerships, like reaching out to\u00a0your sponsors\u00a0who may have access to potential venues.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, take a look at other venues that have been used for popular events in your area. These venues are likely to have extensive experience hosting events and may offer attractive packages. Of course, don't forget the power of a simple Google search and online venue search platforms. These platforms allow you to filter and compare potential venues based on factors like size, location, and amenities. Social media can also be a helpful tool here for you to check out events similar to yours and see where they're hosted.\n\n\n\nFinally, consider public venues managed by your town or city. This type of venue offers unique spaces and amenities, but keep in mind that special permits or permissions may be required. By utilizing these various resources, you'll be sure to find the perfect venue that aligns with your event goals and budget!\n\n\n\nSchedule site visits\n\n\n\nOnce you have narrowed down your list of potential venues, it's time to schedule site visits to examine their suitability for your event. To begin, reach out to your top choices and set up appointments for the site visits. During these visits, prepare a list of questions and needs that you want to discuss with the venue representatives. This could include inquiries about capacity, available amenities, catering options, technical capabilities, and any specific venue requirements for an event. You can also give the venue space (i.e. lobby, restrooms, meeting rooms) a quality check to ensure it meets your standards.\n\n\n\nBy having a prepared list of questions, you can ensure that all your concerns are addressed upfront and that you gather all the necessary information to make your final decision. Distinguish between your \"must-haves\" and your \"nice-to-haves\" when looking at your venue. That way, you can determine which factors are non-negotiable for your event versus which are preferences that would be great to have but are not deal-breakers. This distinction will help you prioritize and evaluate the venues based on how well they meet your specific needs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n15 factors event planners should consider in venue selection\n\n\n\nWhen narrowing down your venue options, there are a number of factors to consider in venue selection for your events. Getting clarification on these upfront ensures you're setting yourself up for success with a smooth\u00a0event day. Now, let's dive in!\n\n\n\n1. Venue cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen selecting an event venue, cost is one of the largest factors. This goes beyond just the flat rental fee for the venue too. It's important to inquire about any extra fees for rentals that may apply, such as charges for extra services or amenities. Ask the venue manager upfront what is included in the price and what is not (like taxes or add-on services). Additionally, it's important to ensure that the rental time includes sufficient venue access for both setup and breakdown. Moreover, it's crucial to budget for additional costs outside of the venue rental fee. These costs can include expenses such as catering, audiovisual equipment, decorations, staffing, and permits. By accounting for these costs upfront for your overall event budget, you can avoid unexpected bills later!\n\n\n\n2. Event date availability\n\n\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, the flexibility of your event date matters! In particular, seasonality can play a significant role in determining the availability and the cost of certain venues. If your event falls around popular holidays or peak seasons, a venue's business may be in high demand, meaning higher prices. Moreover, weekend events are typically more popular than weekdays, and venues may have limited availability or at least cost you more. If you have some flexibility, venues may even offer discounted rates for off-peak dates or last-minute availability.&nbsp;However, if you have a preferred date in mind, you may need to pay a premium price for securing that specific date. Evaluate what your budget is and how much you're willing to spend in order to secure your ideal venue at your preferred time and date.\n\n\n\nBooking for multi-day events\n\n\n\nAnother aspect to consider is whether you require multiple dates for your event. For instance, corporate events or multi-day festivals may need consecutive dates. In such cases, ensure that the venue can accommodate your schedule and discuss the possibility of discounted rates for booking multiple dates.\n\n\n\nInclement weather accommodations\n\n\n\nIf you plan to have an outdoor event, it's crucial to have a contingency plan for inclement weather. Inquire with potential venues on whether they provide options for rescheduling or if they have auxiliary event spaces available indoors. Having the ability to schedule a rain date ensures that your event can proceed smoothly, even if the weather is a bit unpredictable.\n\n\n\n3. Ideal location\n\n\n\nThis will really help put your event on the map (literally)! The ideal location takes your target audience into account. Being in proximity to where your attendees live makes it convenient for them to reach the venue's location, increasing the likelihood that they'll come. It should be an easy-to-find location, and ideally one close to transportation like buses or airports with nearby hotel accommodations. Depending on your budget, picking a memorable venue type to host events (like at a rooftop garden, winery, or historic house) can seriously elevate your experience as well and give attendees lasting memories, so they want to come back for your next event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Comfortable atmosphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoinciding with the general location, you'll also want to prioritize guests' comfort once they're inside your venue space. First impressions of your event are important, so you'll definitely want to impress attendees from the start! Not only is your venue the foundation of your attendees' experience, it's also the background to all your\u00a0event photography\u00a0and promotional materials. So, make it count! Find a place that fits the style of your event, whether that be a cozy, homestyle feel or a more sleek, modern look. The more you like the interior of the building, the less decorating you may have to do. That said, there's something powerful about a blank slate as well! Additionally, consider scheduling your site visits around the same time as your event will happen so you can assess how the natural lighting might impact how your venue looks.\n\n\n\n5. Event venue capacity\n\n\n\nMake sure you carefully consider the capacity of the event space. One must be mindful of how the number of people will navigate your venue. Ensuring that the chosen venue can legally and comfortably accommodate the intended number of guests is essential to create a pleasant experience for everyone. Triple-check whether the event space requirements account for seated or standing room only when researching options. This will be important to avoid overcrowding and make sure that seating doesn't get too tight, as well as to follow safety protocols. You'll also want to have enough space for any preferred vendors and sponsors' booths too. Depending on your expected number of people, there can be value in selecting smaller event venues that have the potential to sell out faster, creating an atmosphere of exclusivity and excitement!\n\n\n\n6. Floor layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosting a successful event ensures every person feels comfortable, engaged, and has an unforgettable experience. The floor layout of your chosen venue plays a pivotal role in achieving that. From the seating arrangement to table placement, every detail contributes to the overall ambiance. Use clear and obvious signage that attendees can easily read, ensuring a hassle-free experience. But it doesn't stop there! Whether you need a stage for performances or a dance floor for vibing, confirm that the right venue has the elements you need to fulfill your vision for the event.\n\n\n\nConsider where to place your\u00a0event's registration\u00a0table for check-in and how you'll accommodate the flow of people entering and exiting. And let's not forget about foot traffic throughout your event. By strategically setting up multiple stations, multiple check-ins, and catering areas as needed, you'll eliminate bottlenecks and keep the flow smooth. Safety is paramount, so verify that it's easy to get to emergency exits too. To help with this, lay out an illustrated floor plan that both staff and attendees can reference.\n\n\n\n7. Accessibility\n\n\n\nTo make your venue accessible to all attendees, verify that there are elevators and ramps as needed so individuals with mobility aids can navigate the space with ease. Ample seating should be provided, especially for an older crowd, to ensure each person is comfortable throughout the event. For families with young kids, ensure there are changing stations available and other potential accommodations like certain rooms dedicated for kids. By taking these accessibility measures into account, event organizers can create an\u00a0inclusive and welcoming environment\u00a0for all attendees.\n\n\n\n8. Food and drink suppliers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fantastic event is one where great food, drinks, and memories come together! If you're planning to have food at your event, clarify whether you'll need to arrange this separately or if the venue will take care of it. If the venue is in charge of the food, remember to consider the minimum number of guests they plan to serve and make sure to invite at least that many people. If you're providing your own or recruiting other food vendors to do your catering, check if the venue has a kitchen available to store and prepare the food. Should you want a bar at your event, ask if the venue has a designated bar area or if they can arrange for bar services. By addressing these aspects, you'll ensure that your guests are well fed and hydrated!\n\n\n\n9. Additional services\n\n\n\nDepending on the size of the prospective venue and your available budget, you may want to ask about services that are included in your contract versus what the venue will provide for an additional cost. Some areas may include:\n\n\n\n\nTraffic control\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\n\nWaste management\n\n\n\nFurniture rental service (e.g., tables, chairs, linens, silverware)\n\n\n\nTransportation (e.g., shuttle services)\n\n\n\nTents, fans, and\/or heating units for outdoor events\n\n\n\nAdditional event staffing\n\n\n\n\nYour needs will vary depending on whether your event is indoors or outdoors, what size it is, and more. Share your complete vision with the venue manager to ensure you've got all your bases covered, allowing you to determine additional services to secure.\n\n\n\n10. Parking availability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParking is a critical aspect of selecting a venue that you should also strategize at a given venue (your guests will have to put their cars somewhere!). Is there ample parking space onsite or nearby? Are there any restrictions or additional fees associated with parking? By addressing these questions, you can give your event attendees peace of mind about finding a parking spot, especially if they can avoid street parking or paying for it. Easy access to a parking lot not only saves time but also enhances the overall experience, allowing attendees to arrive smoothly and let them focus on enjoying the event. If your budget allows for it, you may even consider offering valet service so it's one less thing your attendees need to think about.\n\n\n\n11. Quality of acoustics\n\n\n\nWhen considering a venue for your event, it's important to assess the quality of the acoustics. Wondering if the sound is up to par? Don't hesitate to ask the venue owner about typical comments they receive regarding the sound quality at previous events. It's worth noting that venues with low ceilings tend to amplify sound, while open spaces can create excessive reverb, which may affect clarity. Finding a good balance is key, ensuring that the sound is neither too quiet nor too loud.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n12. Insurance needs\n\n\n\nInsurance requirements will vary depending on the nature and size of the venue. Many times, the venue will have liability insurance covered, so be sure to ask. Some larger venues may have stricter requirements, mandating that event organizers have insurance coverage in place even before negotiating the terms.\n\n\n\nIt is important to communicate with the venue and inquire about the specific insurance requirements and who is responsible for providing them. If a larger venue does not require any insurance or if the coverage seems inadequate, it could be a red flag. Adequate insurance coverage ensures the protection of both the event organizer and the venue, offering peace of mind and safeguarding against unforeseen circumstances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n13. Ample technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour technology needs depend entirely on what kind of event you're organizing. Do you need a projector for presentations? How about a sound system for your entertainment or keynote speakers? Check with the venue manager regarding what resources they have available versus what equipment you'll need to bring yourself. This could include anything from additional lighting to audio-visual equipment. And don't forget about WiFi! Check that your selected venue has strong WiFi available for your attendees to connect to.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n14. Cancellation policy\n\n\n\nThere's always some uncertainty when organizing events. Because of that, you'll want to know the venue's cancellation policy to avoid any unwanted surprises. Should you need to cancel your event, ask the venue if they have a percentage refund policy based on how far in advance you cancel. Clarify whether you'll still be charged a cancellation fee if the event needs to be rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances (like inclement weather). By proactively addressing these questions based on how they've handled past events, you can ensure that you are well informed about the cancellation policy and make decisions with confidence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n15. Ticketing protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll need to check if you should sell your tickets through their venue's provider or if you can use your own. Many venues will let you use a do-it-yourself system like&nbsp;, while others may have a set contract with a specific ticketing service already.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVoil\u00e0! You've got all your bases covered on what to consider when booking your next event. Every event's needs are different, so communicate them as clearly as possible with your venue manager. And once you're ready to host your event,\u00a0TicketLeap's user-friendly system\u00a0is fully prepared to sell your tickets. In the end, you'll look back with confidence knowing your selected venue is the best fit for your event!\n","date":"7 Nov 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6548ec71e6b8ee052ad53190_confetti-at-concert-venue-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

These two essential principles are key ingredients towards unlocking the full potential of your events and celebrating the richness of human differences. Eager to learn more? Let's explore how to make events inclusive!\n\n\n\nWhat is diversity and inclusion?\n\n\n\nDiversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) refers to the essential principles of fostering a sense of belonging, respect, and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, abilities, or characteristics. Simply put, diversity refers to the rich variety of people's differences, including (but certainly not limited to!) race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and religion. As its closely linked yet distinct counterpart, inclusion emphasizes creating an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and empowered to participate fully, without facing discrimination or prejudice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nD&amp;I benefits our communities because it broadens our perspectives and ultimately leads to a more enriching experience for all attendees. Some common barriers to achieving D&amp;I at your events include unconscious biases, limited awareness, and insufficient representation, which can hinder authentic connections with and among your entire audience. Overcoming these challenges requires proactive effort and a commitment to creating inclusive events.\n\n\n\nIncorporating diversity and inclusion in your event planning\n\n\n\nConsider setting clear goals in your&nbsp;event checklist&nbsp;related to D&amp;I, like actively seeking out underrepresented communities or incorporating more inclusive&nbsp;event planning practices&nbsp;in various aspects of your event (e.g., speaker selection, marketing materials, venue choice). To help guide these efforts, engage with community leaders and advocates to understand specific groups, so you can tailor your events to resonate with their interests in an authentic way. Establishing&nbsp;event sponsorships&nbsp;with a diverse array of organizations helps connect us to a broader spectrum of voices too. Other examples of D&amp;I-related planning efforts could include verifying that the venue you book has certain accessibility accommodations, selecting a date for your event that doesn't land on a religious observance day, or ensuring language interpretation services are available.\n\n\n\nPromoting your events with diversity and inclusion in mind\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that genuinely connecting with your audience lies at the heart of successful event marketing! Here are a few ways to improve your&nbsp;marketing materials&nbsp;and better engage with specific communities:\n\n\n\n\nFeature individuals from different backgrounds on your promotional materials, website, and&nbsp;ticketing page&nbsp;to prioritize more representation in your imagery, helping your event resonate with a wide range of attendees and better welcome diversity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCreate colorblind-friendly marketing materials (e.g., your website, social media ads, flyers) by minimizing&nbsp;certain color combinations&nbsp;close together like red and green or purple and blue.\n\n\n\nIncorporate a brief written description to your images on your event's website (known as image alt text) so visually impaired individuals using screen readers can comprehend your visuals and graphics.\n\n\n\nOffer your marketing materials in different languages. To help you prioritize which translations to provide, take a look at the demographics of your target audience and choose the common languages spoken among them.\n\n\n\nInclude captions in your videos to ensure participants who are deaf or hard of hearing can fully enjoy your content.\n\n\n\nParticipate in online communities or forums that align with your event's theme to help build meaningful connections and encourage diverse audiences to join your event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCreate content that reflects the varied interests of different communities to attract a more diverse attendee base.\n\n\n\n\nMaking your event's venue more inclusive&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, it's time to\u00a0choose the perfect venue\u00a0for your event! When selecting a venue, confirm that it has accessibility options, making it easy for people with disabilities or mobility challenges to navigate your event space comfortably. This could include providing accessible parking, elevator access, as well as wheelchair-accessible ramps and seating.\u00a0Live streaming\u00a0your in-person event and hosting additional\u00a0virtual events\u00a0can give even more people the opportunity to enjoy your event remotely (especially those who might not be able to attend otherwise). You may also consider whether your venue has gender-neutral bathrooms available for those who may desire them.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you're serving food, ensure your menu has vegetarian, vegan, and other options for those with dietary restrictions. Think about how your range of food options could cater to people of different cultural backgrounds and create a welcoming atmosphere for all attendees.&nbsp;To help you in these efforts, TicketLeap lets you add&nbsp;custom registration questions&nbsp;at checkout, so you can let your ticket buyers request any specific accommodations they might need.\n\n\n\nFostering diversity and inclusion at your event&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow that you've got your event planning down, let's cover some strategies to enrich your attendees' experience on the day of!\n\n\n\n\nTrain your event staff on how to create an inclusive environment for all attendees, free from any unconscious bias. Set clear guidelines that emphasize treating every attendee with equal respect and consideration.\n\n\n\nConsider&nbsp;hiring bilingual staff&nbsp;or translators to assist attendees in their native language.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEncourage your diverse array of sponsors to engage with attendees on topics they're passionate about and spread awareness regarding relevant social issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOrganize fun activities that require attendees to work together in diverse teams to promote cross-cultural collaboration.\n\n\n\nUse decorations and signage that reflect a wide range of cultures, identities, and perspectives. This can create a more welcoming environment and help your attendees feel more represented.\n\n\n\n\nImproving your future diversity and inclusion efforts\n\n\n\nWhen hosting your diverse event ideas, it's important to continually evaluate whether your efforts are sufficiently and authentically promoting diversity and inclusion at your events. Sending out a&nbsp;post-event survey&nbsp;to your attendees is definitely a great idea to gauge the effectiveness of your D&amp;I initiatives. Through your questionnaire, you could gain their feedback on whether they've felt included, whether your efforts successfully represented various communities, and where you can improve for the future. Armed with these insights, you can take proactive steps to ensure your future events are more diverse and inclusive!\n","date":"7 Nov 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64d4d876222fa3b6dc857f15_diverse-group-of-young-people-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

You're already an expert on selling tickets online for free (just pass those fees along to your ticket buyers!) But now it's time to promote your event, and wouldn't you like to do that for free, too? We've compiled our 17 best tips to sell more tickets online for free (or pretty close to free).\n\n\n\n1. Facebook is your friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust about everyone (as in&nbsp;2.9 billion&nbsp;active monthly users) is on Facebook. Access to that many potential ticket buyers is enough reason to use it.\n\n\n\n2. The early bird gets the deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffer ticket discounts to get people to buy more tickets and to buy early. From early bird to word of mouth deals, there are lots of options for you to try.\n\n\n\n3. Show them what they're missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind people how much fun they had (or could have had) at your last event. This means you'll need to&nbsp;take lots of great photos&nbsp;and videos during the event so you can post them to social media later. You don't need a fancy camera; your iPhone or Android will do the trick. When your next event comes, the fun you captured will be your best promotional tool.\n\n\n\n4. #Hashtag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an event hashtag and share it often. Make sure it's visible on the website you're selling tickets on, and use it in your social media posts when talking about your event.\n\n\n\n5. A picture's worth a thousand words...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen ticket buyers land on your event page, keep their attention by showing them a great image that encompasses your event. This image should make them excited for your event and confident they'll have a great time.\n\n\n\n6. ...But words are pretty important, too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a detailed\u00a0event description, whether you're using your own website or a third-party event page. Descriptive event information lets them know what's included with their ticket and what they should expect from the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Get people talking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter what social media platform you prefer, make sure to post consistently (2-4 times per week) so that your event stays visible. Use interesting or funny pictures and videos\u2014the kind that will make people want to tag their friends in your post. Check out #17 below for tips on how to make your posts look as impressive as your event is (even if you're not a designer).\n\n\n\n8. Alert the media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick a few news outlets you'd like to see your event featured in and reach out to the person who writes about events like yours\u2014usually the Entertainment Editor. Send them an email with the who, what, where, when, why of your event to make it easy for them to write about it. Local blogs can also be a great resource if your event has a niche audience (your yoga in the park event would fit right in with a local fitness blogger's content).\n\n\n\n9. Make sure the price is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your ticket price&nbsp;to convey value to your event goers. People want to feel like their money and their time are well spent. While it may be tempting to price your tickets low to increase sales, a too-low price tag can signal low quality to potential buyers. Don't sell yourself (or your event) short.\n\n\n\n10. Use influencers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk prominent people in your community to help spread the word and give them something in return. Ask them to send personalized&nbsp;email invitations&nbsp;to their networks, or tweet and post about the event in exchange for a comped or discounted ticket. Make it easy on them by giving them pre-written prompts or posts you'd like them to use.\n\n\n\n11. Give 'em some swag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork with a local restaurant or merchant to get some cool gifts for attendees. If you can't figure out enough for every attendee, create a contest\u2014you'll want to make sure the gifts are cool and\/or useful! Think about the setting of your event and how your attendees will feel when they're there. Rainy day? Hand out some ponchos with your logo (or your sponsor's logo) on them. Is your event outdoors in the middle of summer? Branded reusable water bottles! Your attendees will appreciate\u00a0swag they can actually use.\n\n\n\n12. Up your Instagram game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith over a billion users and growing, Instagram is a perfect platform for promoting your event. You'll want to make sure the image you post is good enough to make people stop scrolling and pay attention, so make sure your pictures look great. Since you can't use an active link in your instagram captions (Instagram doesn't have this feature), include the link to your event page in your bio, and include the words \u201clink in bio\u201d in your caption so your followers know to look for it!\n\n\n\n13. Let your dirty work do double duty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou work hard to make sure your event goers have a great experience, so why not double the return on your investment? Snap some pictures of the behind-the-scenes process (think blowing up balloons to create a balloon pit or hammering the last nail into your homemade replica of the throne from Game of Thrones) and post to social for added hype.\n\n\n\n14. Give away your tickets for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, some of them, anyway.&nbsp;Reserve a few tickets&nbsp;for a social media promotion where people have to share your event, use your hashtag, or somehow interact with you on social for a chance to win free tickets.\n\n\n\n15. See my guest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes your event have a high-profile guest? Let their recognizable image stand in for some of your regular advertising. (Don't forget: this is promotion for them, too.) Tweet out a great pic of them or use a tool like&nbsp;WordSwag&nbsp;to post a quote of theirs on Instagram. There's basically no work for you since guests like these bring their own hype.\n\n\n\n16. A word from your sponsor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsorships are a great tool&nbsp;for cross-promotion. Did you find an awesome local restaurant to donate food for your event? Great work! Now promote them (and your event) by reposting a tasty-looking pic of their food on your Instagram. Your potential ticket buyers will be tempted by what they could be eating if they attend. Note: this doesn't just apply to food, so be sure to share donations from your florist, that amazing local gin company, or that party rental business your neighbor owns when they let you borrow their fog machine.\n\n\n\n17. You make this look good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood news: you don't need to be a designer to make your social media promotional posts look great. There are plenty of free design tools out there to help you create polished, professional posts.&nbsp;Canva&nbsp;is a graphic design tool that takes all the guesswork out of creating beautiful designs, and they have lots of social media templates to choose from.&nbsp;Pixlr&nbsp;is an online photo editor with tons of effects to make your pictures look amazing. If you have something specific in mind, YouTube is your best friend, with countless tutorials for pretty much anything you can dream up.\n","date":"27 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/620525e30d63fd3f75cd1ce7_tips-to-sell-more-event-tickets-cover-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Thoughtful planning for a fundraiser can go a long way toward reaching your donation goals. To help you in your brainstorming sessions, we\u2019ve compiled 21 different fundraising event ideas that are sure to engage your community and help exceed your fundraising goals!\n\n\n\n1. Charity run\n\n\n\nProven successful time and time again, hosting a fun run is a classic fundraiser for charities! A walk-a-thon or 5K run are two simple and exciting ways to get your community to rally around your cause. Offer additional items like a free t-shirt or headband with your nonprofit\u2019s branding on them that participants can sport during your run. Looking to add a unique twist to your fundraising event idea? Try turning the event into a color run! For this, your runners will wear all white, then people on the sidelines will deck them out in colored powder as they run your course. Theme these colors to match your nonprofit\u2019s brand colors or the colors representing the issue your organization works with (like pink if your nonprofit fights against breast cancer). These runs are an energizing way to support your cause and bring together community members!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Outdoor festival\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no better way to successfully fundraise for your nonprofit than with a fun festival for all ages! Select a scenic outdoor venue for a day of food, drinks, and entertainment, themed in a way that\u2019s meaningful to your nonprofit community. For example, a conservation organization could throw a flower festival and celebrate in full bloom. Fire up some grills for your attendees, or partner with local restaurants or food trucks to donate their services for your festival in exchange for a sponsorship title and future collaboration opportunities. And what festival would be complete without fireworks, live music, or a DJ so people can dance the night away? As a final touch, request a fixed or pay-what-you-can admissions fee to kick off your fundraising campaign, then continue to collect donations throughout the night with raffles, games, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Dance marathon\n\n\n\nTime to put on your dancing shoes! A trending fundraiser among Millennials and Gen Z especially, dance marathons are an innovative opportunity for your community to support your nonprofit and really make a difference. A dance marathon typically encourages people to dance for between 24-48 hours straight (or until their team \u201cout dances\u201d the others). Before, during, and after the marathon, participants are tasked to find donors who\u2019ll pledge to donate based on their time and energy to dance for the cause. For this, have participants register and their donors give through your dance marathon\u2019s event page.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe marathon itself is a super energetic dance party with one primary rule: always stay moving! Deck out the dance floors with party lights, glow sticks, and anything else that could add to the vibe. To help pass the time with more than dancing, participants can also play games, put on talent shows, and do additional competitions to raise money. At the end of the marathon, celebrate with a huge reveal of how much money was collectively raised, and use this at your next fundraising event as the goal to beat!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. 50\/50 raffle\n\n\n\nA 50\/50 raffle is a simple yet exciting way to raise funds for your nonprofit while giving your supporters a chance to win big! Here\u2019s how it works: participants buy tickets to enter, and at the end of the raffle, half of the total cash pool goes to the lucky winner while the nonprofit keeps the other 50% to support its mission. Simply sell raffle tickets both online and at other fundraising events you're doing. Then, be sure to draw the winner in person at an event. This not only creates a fun, suspenseful moment but also increases the chances of the winner generously donating their 50% back to your cause. With the allure of a cash prize, 50\/50 raffles are a fantastic way to engage your community, raise funds quickly, and add an extra spark to any event!\n\n\n\n5. Charity concert\n\n\n\nBring your community together with live music, and jam out for a good cause! You can make the atmosphere of your concert as high-energy or relaxed as you want with your choice of venue, genre, and artist lineup. If you\u2019re looking to do more than a traditional concert, consider hosting a \u201cBattle of the Bands,\u201d a competition between local bands where a panel of judges and crowd participation determines the winner. After all, the more bands in your lineup, the more people will promote your concert and ultimately your cause. You could also sell tickets to a songwriters\u2019 round where local songwriters come to share their original songs, the stories behind their music, and what your nonprofit means to them. In addition to proceeds from your concert ticket sales, see if your guest artists would also be willing to donate a portion of their merch sales from the night to your cause.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Gala\n\n\n\nPlanning a formal evening is a perfect way to celebrate your charitable efforts at any time of year. Host a sit-down dinner at a beautiful venue where you could serve cocktails, have live music playing, and give attendees plenty of room to mingle. Pair your dinner with a live or silent auction of sponsored gifts from local businesses (like getaway packages, gift baskets, or signed memorabilia) to raise even more toward your goal. Build an eye-catching event listing (like on TicketLeap!) to sell tickets and to collect additional donations before the event even happens.\n\n\n\nTo motivate attendees, display a huge goal thermometer that tracks your fundraising efforts as the night progresses. Throughout your gala, invite relevant speakers to share motivational stories about how your nonprofit organization has impacted them. As a grand finale to your fundraising event, you can even host an awards ceremony to recognize notable members of your organization and in your community, giving back to people just as they\u2019ve given to your organization! To make sure the entire night runs flawlessly and maximize giving, use a ticketing platform to collect your general admissions fee, sell reserved tables for special guests, and collect additional donations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Golf tournament\n\n\n\nHost a friendly sports competition on a local golf course where the day\u2019s proceeds go directly to your nonprofit. Participants will pay to play for the day and compete as individuals or teams. To add to the stakes, get local businesses to sponsor the tournament\u2019s prizes (like athletic gear or gift cards) as well as the event itself. Once the golf tournament has ended and your winners have claimed their prizes, conclude the evening with a celebratory dinner alongside donors, tournament participants, and their families. Sell tickets to compete in your golf tournament, to attend the banquet, or both. With an exciting day planned to give back to your nonprofit, you\u2019re sure to score a hole-in-one with this fundraiser!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Limited-quantity raffle\n\n\n\nHosting a raffle with a limited number of ticket entries is a great way to get more people to buy in and help raise funds for your nonprofit! By capping the number of tickets sold \u2014 say, 100 raffle tickets at $20 \u2014 participants will each have a greater likelihood of potentially winning your prize, making them more eager to join in than if it was a raffle with hundreds of entrants. Think about it, if you raffle off a $500 Amazon gift card that someone donated to your cause and you sell up to 80 tickets for $25, you just raised $2,000! This approach not only will encourage supporters to enter, but it helps your organization hit its fundraising goal faster! You could do this as a stand-alone raffle fundraiser or as a part of other fundraising events you're hosting.\n\n\n\n9. Kid camps\n\n\n\nLooking for a surefire way to impact your community while also raising funds? Try hosting kid camps and youth programs! Imagine hosting a summer camp packed with excitement \u2014 educational workshops that teach STEM skills, sports activities that keep kids active, or arts and crafts sessions that get their creative juices flowing. By charging participation fees and recruiting a few volunteers to assist with the camp, your nonprofit can cover costs and raise money to support its mission. Plus, these programs often attract local sponsors who want to support such enriching experiences for kids. Whether it\u2019s a week-long day camp or just a weekend program, these events not only engage families but also spotlight your nonprofit\u2019s dedication to empowering the next generation!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Educational workshops\n\n\n\nHosting educational workshops is an impactful way to raise funds while sharing your nonprofit's expertise with the community! Depending on your mission, the possibilities are endless. For example, an environmental nonprofit could hold workshops on sustainable gardening or upcycling household items, while an animal shelter might offer pet care tips or dog training classes. These events not only educate attendees but also draw in new supporters who are passionate about your cause. Charge a registration fee or solicit donations during the event to fund your programs. You could also livestream your classes to turn this into an online fundraising event and increase your donations! Once the session is over, don't forget to collect your participants' emails to get their feedback in a post-event survey and keep in touch about future events.\n\n\n\n11. Art auction\n\n\n\nAn art auction is a sophisticated yet engaging way to raise funds and bring your nonprofit\u2019s mission into the spotlight! Partner with talented local artists who are willing to donate their work, and consider inviting them to create pieces that align with your cause. These types of charity auctions could include paintings symbolizing environmental sustainability for a conservation nonprofit or bright portraits of hope benefiting a youth outreach program. Build anticipation by hosting a preview night, where attendees can experience the artwork up close while mingling over drinks and light refreshments. On the big night, you could opt for a silent auction where guests place their bids discreetly or go for the thrill of a live auction starring a charismatic auctioneer to keep the bids climbing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. One-for-one pledges\n\n\n\nOne-for-one pledges are a creative and impactful way to energize participants and maximize donations for your nonprofit! For activity-based fundraising events, consider peer-to-peer fundraising pledges like donating $10 for every lap skated at your roller rink fundraiser or $20 for every mile run during your charity race. This not only motivates participants but also ensures every step or lap goes towards your cause. Selling products? Add a pledge to donate one item for every item purchased \u2014 like giving a school supply kit to a child in need for each reusable water bottle sold. You can even get local businesses involved in one-for-one matching, such as a coffee shop donating one cup for every cup purchased during your event. These ideas create a tangible connection between the event and your mission while inspiring supporters to join in the fun and give generously!\n\n\n\n13. Local restaurant partnerships\n\n\n\nPartnering with local restaurants for special event nights is a win-win way for your organization and your community! Picture this: a local pizzeria agrees to share 20% of its profits from a \u201cCharity Pizza Night\u201d with your nonprofit, encouraging supporters to dine out in support. Or, a neighborhood caf\u00e9 hosts a \u201cCoffee for a Cause\u201d evening, where a dollar from every latte sold is donated to your organization. To spice the night up a little, restaurants can create a special menu item for the night \u2014 like a dessert named related to your mission \u2014 with a portion of proceeds going directly to your mission. In addition to helping generate revenue and bring in extra foot traffic for a local business, this is the perfect fundraising idea to rally your supporters to come together, enjoy great food, and make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Subscription boxes\n\n\n\nSelling subscription boxes can be a creative and consistent way to raise funds for your nonprofit while offering supporters something special to look forward to! As some examples, you could send monthly flower bouquet deliveries, hand-poured candles with unique scents or curated boxes of fresh, locally sourced produce. Focus on items tied to both your organization and the subscription's theme. Be sure to find ways to really think outside the box with this! Not only does this create a steady stream of income, but it\u2019s also a thoughtful gift idea that appeals to donors looking for meaningful ways to support a good cause.\n\n\n\n15. T-shirt design competition\n\n\n\nAs one of the best fundraising ideas for art lovers, encourage community members to flex their artistic skills by submitting unique t-shirt designs that reflect your cause. Charge an entrance fee for each submission, turning every entry into a direct contribution to your mission. Once the designs are in, encourage some healthy competition with a voting period (in-person or online) for the public to pick the winner. Use the winning design to create custom t-shirts you can sell at future events or through your website, and consider printing it on other branded merchandise like tote bags or mugs to expand your fundraiser\u2019s reach. Not only does this competition raise funds through entry fees and merchandise sales, but it also turns your supporters into ambassadors for your cause as they proudly wear or use the branded items, spreading awareness everywhere they go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Social media challenges\n\n\n\nEmbrace the power of social media to rally support, raise funds, and spread awareness for your nonprofit! Think about challenges that align with your mission, like a fitness challenge where participants pledge to walk or run a certain number of miles, a creative art challenge to design something inspired by your cause, or a storytelling challenge where supporters share how your organization has personally impacted them. Create a catchy, unique hashtag to unify your posts (e.g., #ArtForImpact) and make it easier to track the challenge's participation. Whether it's Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or another platform, encourage participants across the web to share their personal experiences and tag friends, helping to generate a ripple effect of awareness and peer-to-peer fundraising to your donation page.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n17. Paint and sip\n\n\n\nLooking for a fun and social way to raise money for your nonprofit? Hosting a paint and sip event might be just the thing! Set up at a cozy venue \u2014 maybe a local winery, art studio, or a community center \u2014 and provide all the materials your guests need, like canvases, brushes, and paints. Have a local artist lead the session with a specific theme or let your attendees get creative with a blank canvas. Pair this fundraising activity with a selection of beverages to keep it relaxed and enjoyable. Sell tickets ahead of time and add a donation option on your fundraising page for those who want to give extra support. To build a buzz around this fundraising campaign, promote this event to local art communities, post about it across social media, and tap into your email list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Virtual events\n\n\n\nConnect with potential donors across the globe like never before and drive more support for your organization with virtual events. The possibilities for your online fundraising events are endless! Consider hosting a virtual conference or workshop to inform people about your cause. You could also try a series of webinars with leaders in your community and individuals impacted by the work you do. Arrange an entertaining evening for the whole family, like a trivia night complete with a MC and prizes. Live-streaming your events on TikTok and other social platforms is also a powerful way to share more about your cause with people. You should even consider hosting hybrid fundraising events to get even more people involved both in person and virtually!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19. Give-It-Up challenge\n\n\n\nA \"Give-It-Up\" challenge is a creative and personal way to inspire supporters to raise money for your nonprofit while making small sacrifices for a big impact! Ask participants to give up a habit (like skipping their daily lattes, eating out, or buying snacks) for a set time, such as a week or month, and to donate the money they save during that period. Organize the challenge by creating an easy-to-use registration page where participants can sign up, track their progress, and make their donations. Use social media to promote the event, share tips for sticking to their goals, and feature stories from participants of the challenge. To boost engagement, offer incentives like public shoutouts, small prizes, or certificates of completion for those who hit their donation goals. By the end, your participants will feel fulfilled for supporting your cause by letting go of a habit!\n\n\n\n20. Cake walk\n\n\n\nWant to take your traditional bake sale fundraising idea up a notch? Host a cake walk! It's a sweet and simple way to bring your community together while raising funds for your nonprofit. To get started, select a venue like a school gym, park pavilion, or community center, and decorate it to create a welcoming atmosphere. Gather an assortment of cakes donated by local bakeries, volunteers, or supporters \u2014 anything from Bundt cakes to cupcakes will work! Set up a circle with numbered spots and play lively music as participants walk around; when the music stops, you draw a number, and whoever is standing on that number wins a cake. Sell tickets online to join the rounds and sell other baked goods onsite too for additional funds. On top of supporting your nonprofit, attendees will love the chance to win a delicious homemade treat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21. Murder mystery dinner\n\n\n\nTurn a night of sleuthing into a powerful fundraiser for your nonprofit with a murder mystery dinner! As a fitting fundraising event around Halloween especially, start by picking an exciting theme \u2014 like \"1920s Speakeasy\" or \"Haunted Mansion\" \u2014 and secure a venue that sets the scene, such as a banquet hall or even a community center transformed to match your story\u2019s backdrop. Sell tickets to the dinner and show experience, design a themed menu, and offer opportunities for additional donations throughout the night (e.g., a raffle or a silent auction). Recruit volunteers or local actors to play the roles and guide the storyline, or if your organization is a theater or another performing arts organization, cast the talented performers you already have! It\u2019s a great way to excite and entertain, while bringing attention to your nonprofit\u2019s cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaise money like never before at your next fundraising event\n\n\n\nWith a solid fundraising goal and an exciting event, you\u2019re bound to raise more funds for your nonprofit organization than ever before.

Hosting awesome events throughout the school year can help you meet your online fundraising goals and give your high school students creative opportunities to make memories they'll be telling their own kids about! Here are a few of our favorite fundraising ideas for high schools that are sure to be a hit!\n\n\n\n1. Themed dances\n\n\n\nHomecoming and prom are always the most anticipated events of any school year, so boost the excitement all year long by throwing some extra themed school dances as fundraising events in between! Plus, who doesn't like an excuse to dress up? You can theme these dances around holidays (Christmas, Valentine's Day, etc.), the seasons (like a spring formal or a fall barn dance), or other ideas that make your students want to throw on their dancing shoes. Deck out your school gym based on your theme, crank up the music, and dance the night away! Want to add a little extra to your fundraising total? In addition to selling tickets for these dances, consider selling concessions like soda and snacks throughout the night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Annoying song challenge\n\n\n\nLooking for a hilariously creative way to fundraise? Try the \"Annoying Song Challenge\" as found on TikTok! Here\u2019s how it works: pick a song that\u2019s guaranteed to get stuck in everyone\u2019s head \u2014 think something silly, repetitive, and just a little bit obnoxious. Then, play it on repeat between class periods, making it the unavoidable anthem of the hallways. The twist? Students, teachers, and staff can donate to make the music stop! Set a fundraising goal, and once it\u2019s reached, free the school from its musical torment. It\u2019s a laugh-out-loud way to raise money while uniting everyone in a shared mission to end the madness. Plus, it\u2019s bound to be a memory they\u2019ll talk about for years, all while supporting a meaningful cause!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Showcases\n\n\n\nYour school community is packed with untapped creative potential! Hosting a showcase gives students the perfect way to share their talents (in music, art, acting, fashion \u2013 you name it!) with the community members of the school. To boost your ticket sales and your fundraising efforts, consider requesting a \u201cpay what you can\u201d admission fee as well as selling popcorn and other small concessions at the door. Really want to sweeten the deal and encourage some friendly competition? Put together a gift card, cash prize, or exclusive school incentive like a \u201cget out of class early\u201d ticket for the best in each category. To amp up the excitement even more, like your own America's Got Talent, have a panel of teachers judge and pick the winners. Who knows, some of those students might become famous one day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Restaurant nights\n\n\n\nPartner with a local restaurant to host a fundraising night where a percentage of the profits are donated to your school. Then, spread the word and pack the place with students, their families, and their friends to all share a meal together. Be sure to pick a restaurant your student body already loves to go to or has always wanted to try! If you can't settle on just one, partner with food or ice cream trucks to come to your school and share the profits of the school fundraiser that way. Students will enjoy getting to skip the cafeteria food and support their school in the process of raising money!\n\n\n\n5. Color runs\n\n\n\nMore than just a typical run, a color run encourages all participating students to wear all white clothes (and maybe some sunglasses) while they run a 5K. Fans on the sidelines throw colored powder at them as they go past, and by the end, they'll be decked out in a super cool array of colors and have some Instagram-worthy photos to share! These color runs are much less competitive, walk-friendly, and more appealing to younger audiences, making it a perfect event for your high school. Through your event's ticketing page, you can charge an entry fee, sell school T-shirts and invite students to wear during the run, ask for additional donations, or even sell the chance to throw some extra colored powder at people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Half-time competitions\n\n\n\nAs students have fun cheering on their school's teams against their biggest rivals, try adding to the fun with crowd games that will really make them go wild (and help you raise funds). For example, set up a \u201cGoal Shot\u201d game where people pay to take a shot at halftime for a chance to win prizes. You can also host a raffle, spin-to-win game, relay race, or other fun contests on the playing field to encourage students to help score those fundraising goals for your school.\n\n\n\n7. Penny wars\n\n\n\nGet ready to spark some excitement with a penny war fundraiser! Here\u2019s how it works: each class gets a giant jug to decorate and display in a prominent place at your school. Students then bring in as many pennies as they can find \u2014 anything from rolls of pennies to loose change from piggy banks and couch cushions \u2014 all in an effort to fill their jug to the brim! The class with the heaviest jug of pennies wins a prize, like a pizza party, an ice cream social, or even an extended lunch break to celebrate their teamwork. This idea pairs friendly competition with community giving, inspiring students, teachers, and families to come together for a great cause. Plus, those small contributions really add up \u2014 you\u2019ll be amazed at how fast those pennies turn into substantial funds for your school!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Silent auctions\n\n\n\nSilent auctions are a classic school fundraising event that students and parents alike love. Essentially, people donate items or experiences that the audience will then bid on. And the opportunities are endless! For parents, offer things that'll make their lives or their children's lives easier, like reserved parking spots at games or date night packages. If one of your high school sports' teams is willing to help, offer to \u201crent the team\u201d for a day to do lawn work, rake leaves, or shovel snow. For students, auction off perks like off-site lunch privileges or prime designated parking spots. Then sit back and watch the funds roll in!\n\n\n\n9. Carnival nights\n\n\n\nThrow a carnival in your school's parking lot and get ready for a full weekend of fun! Sell wristbands at the door and let your students, their families, and the local community enjoy thrilling rides like the Merry-Go-Round, Gravitron, Zipper, and so much more. Sell classic carnival food like cotton candy or hot dogs to really sell the experience, pay to play games and win prizes, or even sell the chance to dunk teachers in a dunk tank!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Prom potty\n\n\n\nLooking to add some viral flair to your next school fundraiser? The \"Prom Potty\" fundraiser, inspired by this viral video on TikTok, is an absolute riot! For this fundraising idea, students take an old toilet, beat it up, and go all out decorating it with paint, glitter, or goofy designs. Then, this porcelain masterpiece gets placed in someone\u2019s front yard until that homeowner donates to have it removed or pay a bit more to send it to another person\u2019s yard of their choosing. Want to guarantee your yard stays toilet free? Donate a certain amount (e.g., $100) to keep it off your lawn. This hilarious fundraiser not only creates unforgettable memories but also brings the community together in good spirits! Be sure to have a team of volunteers ready to move the potty from house to house, and don\u2019t forget to add a sign explaining your mission to anyone driving by. Whether you\u2019re raising money for prom or another project for the school, the \"Prom Potty\" is bound to make everyone laugh, while racking up plenty of funds!\n\n\n\n11. Community yard sale\n\n\n\nOrganizing a yard sale not only provides an opportunity for your school to raise funds but also cultivates a greater sense of school spirit among students, parents, and your local community. To start, encourage students\u2019 families and your community to donate gently used items for the school to sell. Volunteers from your school community can contribute their time to sort, price, and organize the items for the sale too. Then, promote the school fundraising event through social media, local news stations, and community bulletin boards, to attract a wide audience. Not only will you earn additional funds to support your school\u2019s efforts, people will get deals on some awesome new items in the process!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Teacher challenges\n\n\n\nBuild a buzz around the school that the principal will do something crazy if the school can raise a certain amount and get students excited to donate to make it happen. Get their favorite teachers, the theater director, the PE instructor, or other daring faculty in on the stunt as well! Based on successful ideas used by other schools, you can cover them in slime or silly string, stick them to the wall with tape, throw pies in their faces, or even have them do the chicken dance while wearing a chicken costume.\n\n\n\n13. No fuss fundraiser\n\n\n\nFor a low-effort, high-impact fundraiser, try a \"No Fuss Fundraiser\"! As a popular idea shared on TikTok, simply send students home with a form labeled \"No Fuss Fundraiser,\" presenting parents with a humorous breakdown of donation options. For example, \u201cDonate $25 since it\u2019s what you would\u2019ve spent on baking cupcakes for a bake sale anyway!\u201d or \u201cContribute $50 to skip signing up for a walkathon and getting a free t-shirt.\u201d It\u2019s a clever and time-saving way to directly support the school while giving busy parents a laugh. While some families may really appreciate this simple approach to fundraising, don\u2019t forget to mix in those classic high school fundraising ideas as well. Traditional fundraising events not only help raise money but also create incredible memories for students and their families!\n\n\n\nTry out our creative fundraising ideas for high schools!\n\n\n\nAs you begin to put your favorite fundraising ideas into action, consider using an event ticketing platform to streamline your fundraising efforts.

Whether it's for selling concessions or running a lighting board and sound system, building a committed and capable team will make a huge difference for your event.\n\n\n\nRead on for five key considerations to keep in mind when hiring event staff so you can make sure everything goes off without a hitch!\n\n\n\n1. Brush up on local regulations\n\n\n\nBefore you begin to hire event staff, be sure to check out the legal requirements for events in your area. A quick Google search for regulations in your state will help you get to know the rules about staffing for events. For example, you may need to obtain permits or licenses to sell alcohol, host live music, or use certain venues. You also may need liability insurance to protect yourself, attendees, and staff in case of accidents. We recommend having a signed contract with each member of your staff to make sure they know exactly what they\u2019re signing up to do and what your expectations are. Plus, being transparent builds trust and helps maintain positive relationships with your event staff!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Know the roles you need\n\n\n\nDepending on the experience you\u2019re hosting, you\u2019ll probably need a wide variety of event staff on the books. Here are a few examples of common event staffing needs:\n\n\n\nSecurity&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs one of the key elements of your onsite strategy, having security measures in place ensures everyone who attends feels safe and secure. It also helps prevent incidents and protects the liability of clients and event organizers.\n\n\n\nEvent production&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYour production crew is the unsung hero of any event, working behind the scenes to manage sound, lighting, and any other technical aspects to make the event successful and ensure everything runs smoothly. This should be one of your first hires!\n\n\n\nRegistration and check-in\n\n\n\nYour attendees will likely all arrive around the same time, so it\u2019s a good idea to station some staff members at each entrance to check them in, and station some to manage the box office for those buying tickets at the door. Bonus tip: ask your sponsors to send some swag or postcards for you to give away at registration, so their brand is the first thing attendees see!\n\n\n\nEvent set up and tear down\n\n\n\nHaving a dedicated team for this task will ensure everything looks perfect before the event starts and is cleaned up afterwards. Create a list of all the needed tasks for the head of this team to delegate, taking some responsibilities off your plate.\n\n\n\nRefreshments\n\n\n\nDepending on the size of your event, you may need to hire people to sell concessions. If you\u2019re offering a buffet, stations, or a sit-down dinner, consider hiring a catering team to cook the food for you as well as help set up, serve, and tear down afterwards.\n\n\n\nPhotography and videography\n\n\n\nHaving designated staff grabbing stellar photos and videos for your event will ensure you have professional photos for your social media posts, promo for future events, press releases, and sponsorship proposals. If this isn\u2019t in your budget just yet, check out our event photography guide to learn how to take awesome photos yourself!\n\n\n\nChild assistance\n\n\n\nChild care can help make the event enjoyable for both parents and children by keeping kids entertained with fun activities like making crafts or watching a movie. Depending on the number of attendees using this service, you might even consider dividing this by different age groups with different activities.\n\n\n\nVolunteers\n\n\n\nVolunteers help reduce costs and maximize resources while fostering a community-oriented spirit at the event! Their onsite responsibilities can range from helping with check-in, to handing out free T-shirts, to selling snacks. In exchange for their time, they are usually happy to be compensated with access to your event.\n\n\n\n3. Consider your event budget&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHaving a team full of the best staff available is the goal, and you need to carefully budget to make sure you can afford everyone\u2019s wages alongside all other aspects of your event. Now, you might be wondering, how much do event staff get paid? Your staff members\u2019 rates will depend on a few factors, like what you need them to do and how much expertise they have. Research the pay rates for similar staff positions at other events to ensure you\u2019re offering a competitive rate and planning your budget accordingly. It also depends on the nature of the job. For example, a catering or a production team may have a predetermined rate for their services, while you may set the hourly rate or a set dollar figure for your check-in staff.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4. Recruit for your staff positions\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve determined what roles your event needs, it\u2019s time to get the word out there and find quality candidates! Post a job offer on hiring sites like ZipRecruiter, Simply Hired, or Idealist, as many contractors and freelancers turn there first for job opportunities. Be descriptive with your post and include your pay range, needed qualifications, and expected responsibilities to reach the right candidates. For positions requiring specific experience or skill sets, you could also partner with a staffing agency, as they have access to a larger pool of potential applicants and have worked with other event planners.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Interview and hire your team!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast but not least, it\u2019s time to interview your applicants and finalize your onsite crew. Remember that when you\u2019re choosing who will be a part of your team, even for a day, you need to pick those who have the skills you need and whose vision aligns with yours. And that starts with asking the right questions. They\u2019ll vary depending on the position (i.e., if it\u2019s focused more on soft skills like customer service or technical skills like photography). Here are a few examples to help you get started:\n\n\n\n\nTell me about a time when you worked on a project that required you to work both independently and as a team?\n\n\n\nDo you have experience using event ticketing software?\n\n\n\nHow have you dealt with unexpected situations while onsite?\n\n\n\nDescribe your previous experience working with events similar to ours.\n\n\n\n\nWhen setting up the interview, pick a medium that works best for you. In-person or remote interviews, one-on-ones or in a group, and one-off meetings or multi-round sessions are all decisions you\u2019ll need to make based on the scope of your needs. The key is to find an approach that supports your organization and helps you build a strong team. Once you\u2019re done interviewing and selecting staff, give your newest team members a warm welcome just in time for your next event!\n\n\n\nNow that you know what goes into hiring event staff, be sure you have the right ticketing partner by your side! With an easy-to-use ticketing system like TicketLeap, you\u2019ll gain a friendly support team and a full set of features to cover your every need.\n","date":"16 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6446ac48c12607ecdb5af7fa_two-staff-members-hanging-a-painting-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

Thrill-seekers are dying to test their bravery at your haunted house, hayride, or maze, so you need to make the most of that excitement by promoting your event to as many potential customers as possible. Dive into our team's online marketing tips and tricks that are sure to help you drive more revenue, get your event in front of more audiences, and keep your attendees coming back again and again to experience the thrilling terror of the season!\n\n\n\nWhat is event marketing?\n\n\n\nBefore we dive in: what is event marketing, and how can it help your haunted attraction? It's simple! Event marketing is how you promote your haunt and can range from asking your friends and family to spread the word, to posting on social media, to developing a multi-pronged digital marketing campaign. To put it in layman's terms, it's an opportunity to connect with potential attendees in a way that makes sense for your business. Building a quality marketing strategy is a key step in your overall success!\n\n\n\nPlanning for success with KPIs\n\n\n\nBefore getting into the weeds on how to market your most terrifying haunt yet, it's vital to have attainable goals on your event's overall performance that are specific to you. Then, you can set benchmarks along the way to measure whether you're making good progress towards your goals or not. These smaller milestones are called key performance indicators (or KPIs, for short). As your team markets your haunted attraction, use those KPIs to gauge the success of your efforts. While the season goes on, you can assess your data and adjust your marketing strategies accordingly. Here's a few examples of KPIs that could benefit your haunted attraction:\n\n\n\n\u200dNumber of tickets sold\n\n\n\nThe number of tickets you sell is directly tied to your overall revenue and how many attendees you can expect on the big day, so it's a great way to&nbsp;measure the success of your haunt! Start selling tickets early so you have plenty of time to reach as many potential buyers as possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\u200dRevenue\n\n\n\nYour haunt has multiple revenue streams coming in such as ticket sales, merchandise, and additional onsite experiences. Review what has historically been the most popular, and try to determine why. You can adjust your marketing efforts to showcase your staple haunted attractions, or bring more awareness to experiences that attendees may not know about.\n\n\n\n\u200dNumber of event check-ins\n\n\n\nSometimes, the number of event check-ins can be even more important than the number of tickets sold. If you notice a large number of people are buying tickets but not showing up, you might want to adjust your marketing efforts to keep people hyped up between the time they buy their tickets and finally enter your haunt.\n\n\n\n\u200dAttendee engagement\n\n\n\nKeep an eye on the number of shares, likes, or mentions your event gets on social media, and which types of posts perform the best. If you're&nbsp;sending email campaigns, note how many opens and clicks you get, and be sure to track which email is getting the most people to buy tickets.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttendee experience\n\n\n\nGauge your attendees' opinions of your attractions with in-checkout questionnaires and post-event surveys. Customize your questions to discover how they found your event, how scary their experience was, and how to make your haunted house even better next Halloween!\n\n\n\n\u200dEvent marketing strategies to drive more revenue\n\n\n\nSell online tickets on a branded event page\n\n\n\nFirst thing's first: you need an eye-catching, easy-to-navigate event ticketing page to link to from your marketing campaigns. You want your event page to look like an extension of your brand and have an easy purchase flow, so it's important to work with an online ticketing system that can tailor everything to your liking. Bonus points if they offer professional-looking templates to help get you started, or put the power in your hands to build a fully branded event page from scratch that looks great on both desktop and mobile. Be sure to highlight all the most important aspects of your event, including the dates and times, where it's located, the best aspects of your experience, and any other additional information your attendees should know before they arrive, like parking info.\n\n\n\nSend targeted email blasts\n\n\n\nA great place to start with sending email campaigns is to target your attendees from past years. You already know this audience has an interest in your haunt, so now you can wow them with all the new thrills you're going to have this year. Consider using discount codes to get them to buy now. Send a 10% off discount code if customers purchase their tickets by a certain date to incentivize an early sale. Or capitalize on your attendees' social circle by offering a friends and family discount, like 15% off when they buy four or more tickets. \u200d For the most successful email campaigns possible, be sure to follow these tips:\n\n\n\n\nInclude an attention-grabbing subject line that stands out in the inbox - emojis encouraged! (e.g., It's Aliiiive!&nbsp;\ud83e\udddf This Year's Haunt is Here!)\n\n\n\nMake use of your preheader text to expand on your subject line (e.g., Casper's Haunted House is back and bigger than ever! Get your tickets today!)\n\n\n\nPersonalize your emails by using dynamic content to add your recipients' names either in the subject line or in the body of your email\n\n\n\nAdd a terrifying image of your haunted house to get your audience hyped up\n\n\n\nAdd details about your event, like where and when it is and a description of what to do there\n\n\n\nAdd a clear call to action to buy tickets now and link to your event listing\n\n\n\n\nLastly, be sure to check if you can send out free email campaigns directly from your ticketing system. Not only will it help keep costs down, but your ticket buyer information will already be stored there, so it'll make segmenting your customers and building branded emails a snap!\n\n\n\nSpread the holiday fear on social media\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to scaring up interest in your haunt, never underestimate the power of social media! All year long, and especially during haunt season, you should be posting regularly on your&nbsp;Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media profiles so you can engage with your fans and connect with new audiences. No matter what platforms you advertise on, your haunt's social media marketing presence should be focused on giving audiences a taste of the thrills and chills they can expect to see at your event (and encouraging them to buy tickets right away, of course!).\n\n\n\nPost&nbsp;high-quality video and photos, and keep your captions short and to the point. Grab readers' attention fast and always end with a direct call to action, like&nbsp;\u201cGet your tickets while they last!\u201d&nbsp;After your customers purchase tickets, you can keep the engagement going and even turn them into free brand ambassadors by inviting them to share your event to their own social profiles! \u200d To get the most out of your social media campaigns, try out these tips and tricks:\n\n\n\nStay active\n\n\n\nPost at least once a day and aim for 7-10 posts per week leading up to your event.\n\n\n\nQuality over quantity\n\n\n\nPost content that is super interesting and helpful to your followers. Spread the word about your event and promotions, and also highlight your community and give shoutouts to fans.\n\n\n\nCreate event hashtags\n\n\n\nHashtags are a fun tool for getting discovered by new audiences. Use 1-3 hashtags per post, including a brand-specific hashtag. That way, each platform will&nbsp;serve up your posts in search results, making it easier for you to #SpreadTheHolidayFear\n\n\n\nInvite people to follow\n\n\n\nDirectly invite your friends and those interested in your haunt to follow you right from an action on your Facebook Page!\n\n\n\nInclude your Facebook and Instagram handle on everything (and we mean everything)\n\n\n\nThe more places your social media handles appear, the more opportunities there are for people to follow. Include your handle on all your online posts, printed materials, and offline advertising campaigns.\n\n\n\nDesign Facebook and Instagram posts to generate followers\n\n\n\nInclude calls to action in the post text, like,&nbsp;\u201cTag the friend you'd want to be stuck in a zombie apocalypse with!\u201d\n\n\n\nEngage with existing communities and follow relevant accounts\n\n\n\nUse Instagram Search to find hashtags, geotags, and handles of people who are in your area. Get involved by liking, sharing, and commenting on their content! Many people will return the favor and follow you if they like what they see.\n\n\n\nRegularly post video content\n\n\n\nPost videos on TikTok\u00a0and Instagram to take advantage of their massive Gen Z user base to reach a younger demographic and find new repeat customers for years to come. Take your followers through parts of your haunted house, introduce them to artists, show time lapses of setup, and more. In the lead-up to opening day, post content of behind-the-scenes tours to get people excited to see your haunt.\n\n\n\nShare user-generated content\n\n\n\nWhile at your event, encourage attendees to post from your haunt using your custom hashtag (exp: #HauntedHillsManor). Whenever you need content, simply search your hashtag on Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram, and look for smiling faces enjoying your experience and re-share their posts on your profile!\n\n\n\nCreate special promotions for your haunted attraction\n\n\n\nThe key to a good haunted attraction advertising campaign is keeping the focus local. Start by making a list of news outlets, online magazines, blogs, and other locally-targeted, high-traffic websites you want to purchase online ad placements from. A lot of these outlets offer banner ad placements, in-article ads, and even paid inclusion in their email newsletters, which will get your haunted attraction in front of thousands of potential customers. (Pro tip: make the most of these placements by offering a small discount to those who purchase tickets right away!)\n\n\n\nYour local community is the perfect audience for some offline engagement, too! Classic marketing tactics like flyers, print magazine and newspaper ads, and even billboards are tried and true ways to drive more ticket sales. For example, consider partnering with local restaurants, retailers, and grocery stores to pass out discount coupons for your haunted attraction to their customers. A partnership with local businesses might be just what you need to give your ticket sales that extra little boost. \u200dBeyond these more \u201ctraditional\u201d routes, you should also consider the benefits of influencer marketing. Scope out local personalities and social media influencers with a devoted following, and work with them to&nbsp;arrange a partnership. You might even find that influencer marketing can be more affordable and much more powerful in reaching new audiences than other paid advertising methods!\n\n\n\nTrack discounts, promotions, and special pricing\n\n\n\nOffering&nbsp;exclusive discounts&nbsp;to specific audiences is a sure-fire way to boost ticket sales. Encourage attendees to buy early with early-bird discounts. Offer special group rates for families and friends to attend together for less. Create a loyalty program to reward recurring thrill-seekers and keep them coming back throughout the season. You can even sell tickets to VIP experiences or speed passes to skip the lines for all your haunted attractions! No matter how you offer specially priced event tickets, ensure you're tracking your efforts. Attach unique tracking parameters on the links to your event page for each promotion or discount code to determine exactly where your ticket sales are coming from.\n\n\n\nGet the word out with online paid advertising\n\n\n\nPaid social advertising\n\n\n\nDepending on your budget, interest targeting on Facebook is a great way to increase awareness, gain new followers, and sell out tickets to your haunted attraction. Facebook Ads Manager provides a bunch of ways to target potential customers across both Facebook and Instagram. When it comes to interest targeting, a user's \u201cinterests\u201d are based on what they share on their timelines, the apps they use, the ads they click, the pages they like, and more. That means you should target your ads to interests relevant to your haunt, like&nbsp;other haunted attractions and events, horror films, and Halloween in general.\n\n\n\nYou may also want to explore&nbsp;Lookalike Audiences&nbsp;to unlock a new audience and grow your brand awareness even more after you've collected enough purchase data. Lookalike Audiences are created from a source audience of already existing customers. Facebook then identifies common characteristics and creates a new audience that mirrors the source. Basically, that means all the heavy lifting is done for you, and you reap the rewards! \n\n\n\nImportant note: you're most likely reaching a new audience who may not have heard of your haunted attraction before, so make sure your text is friendly, informative, and sufficiently spooky. Include your haunt's details, location, run time, and a fun call-to-action to purchase tickets alongside the \u201cBook Now\u201d button. For your ad creative, test between static images, short videos, and carousel ads to see what your audience likes best. Select the most thrilling photos of your event to stop people in their tracks as they're scrolling. Remember, this is a new audience, so you want to feature the most popular aspects of your haunted attraction!\u200d\n\n\n\nSocial media remarketing\n\n\n\nDid you know you could specifically target website visitors who checked out your haunted house but haven't purchased a ticket yet? Remarketing helps you zero in on people who have shown interest, but haven't quite sealed the deal. Since they've already engaged with your website, these users are way more likely to place an order, so it's usually more efficient to re-target them again than start a new, broader campaign.\n\n\n\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are great places to run remarketing campaigns because that's where your customers already spend a lot of their time. If you have customer lists from previous years, it's also a good idea to remarket to them. Uploading a list of email addresses and other contact information to Facebook lets you target those specific users with your social media ads.\n\n\n\nWell-timed, targeted, and interesting remarketing ads can easily be the most effective part of your social media marketing toolkit! \u200d For remarketing ads, use reminder language to get them to buy tickets, while also adding new information about your haunt, featuring a testimonial from a recent visitor or influencer, or highlighting a part of your event they might not already be aware of. Create a sense of urgency to get customers to buy tickets right away (e.g., \u201cHalloween is approaching - don't miss out on the fun of spooky season!\u201d). Offering a discount to these audiences is another great motivator, like 20% of children's tickets or free parking. Sometimes the opportunity to save a few bucks is all it takes!\n\n\n\nStart working with a free, user-friendly ticketing system\n\n\n\nWhile it's possible to create a successful, multi-pronged marketing strategy on your own, using an event ticketing and management system sure does make it a whole lot easier!

In this initial stage, collecting data on your current audience will help you determine the ideal size and types of the businesses to partner with for your events. To determine this, use answers from your&nbsp;registration questions&nbsp;at checkout to learn more about your ticket buyers.

Compile the stats\n\n\n\nPut together a&nbsp;sponsorship deck&nbsp;or document to highlight your attendee demographics as well as your various offerings (we'll get to this in a moment). Be sure to include your event's expected attendance and your average traffic to your social media, website, and newsletters. Thanks to these hard numbers, you'll present a more compelling pitch to your potential sponsors by showing how much exposure they'll receive and how many new leads they could gain by partnering with you.\n\n\n\n3. Put together your list of potential sponsors\n\n\n\nThink about what kinds of companies would want to connect with your audience. If you have a niche audience, look for companies that match those interests (like an indie artist partnering with a local radio station for their concert). If you have a larger audience with a wide range of interests, focus on organizations that are looking for brand awareness and want to promote heavily. Local businesses like restaurants and utility companies can be a great fit here. As a rule of thumb, smaller events are the perfect outlet for small business partnerships, while larger events may be better suited for corporate sponsors.\n\n\n\na. Use your network\n\n\n\nIncrease your odds of getting sponsorships by starting with the people on your list who you already know. An established relationship can go a long way towards getting a yes. If you get a no, that's alright! Use it as an opportunity to get feedback on how you can be more appealing to sponsors, increasing your success with future pitches.\n\n\n\nb. Pinpoint your community's heavy hitters\n\n\n\nResearch organizations that are popular locally and actively promoting themselves. You could also investigate who tends to sponsor other events in your area, or even visit their vendor booths yourself at other local events like festivals, fairs, or conventions. That way, you can network with potential sponsors in person, so when you reach out to them later, they'll remember your conversation!\n\n\n\nc. Find sponsors online\n\n\n\nDon't underestimate the power of a simple Google search! By doing so, you can easily target organizations that align with your mission. You can see what events they might already be sponsoring and who to contact about sponsoring yours. Plus, you may come across partnership suggestions that you might not have come up with yourself.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of sponsorships you should offer\n\n\n\nWant to know how to get sponsors for an event? It's no secret \u2013 offer irresistible sponsorship packages! For example, if you're hosting a beverage festival, giving a local brewery the chance to show off their latest brew is a match made in heaven. By showing prospects that you've done your homework and already have effective sponsorship ideas lined up, you'll gain their confidence and land some awesome deals!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpecific sponsorship placements\n\n\n\nThink about your event's unique experiences and how you can incorporate potential sponsors into them in a natural way. Consider giving them a booth onsite to interact with attendees, collect their contact info, and turn them into future customers. Use their company's name and logo across your event's signage and promotional materials to increase brand visibility. You could also use their logo on merchandise, drinking cups, handheld fans, or even a photo booth with the sponsor's name printed out on the photo.\n\n\n\nConsider what your attendees may really want too! Branded art installations, sponsored cooling stations on a hot summer day, or a meal provided by your sponsor are sure hits, leaving attendees with a positive impression of your sponsor's brand.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTiered sponsorships\n\n\n\nWith&nbsp;tiered sponsorships, your sponsor can determine what price suits them and, in exchange, how much their brand is used throughout the event. A lower tier might offer brand placements in your newsletters and promotional materials or a shoutout on social media. With higher tiers comes greater visibility, like sponsoring a happy hour or your performance lineup, and potentially even a title sponsorship, if they want to go all out for your event!\n\n\n\nNon-monetary sponsorships\n\n\n\nWhile sponsorships typically involve money, they might offer other resources or perks instead in exchange for exposure at your event. If you're in need of a caterer, consider finding a local food truck to feed your attendees in exchange for free event promotion. Work with a local radio station to help spread word about your event in exchange for a booth at your venue. The recipe for the perfect sponsorship is one that lets you use each others' strengths and meet each other's needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to approach sponsors\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to find sponsors for an event as amazing as yours, how do you convince them to partner with you? One of the trickiest parts of landing sponsorships is figuring out the best way to approach potential partners. An email is a great way to start the conversation, but you'll need to go the extra mile to make sure yours is at the top of their inbox (especially because business owners and other decision makers often get tons of requests and pitches). Here are some questions to consider so you can cut through the noise and get the response you're looking for:\n\n\n\n\nWho?&nbsp;\u2013 At large companies, it's often the marketing team who makes the decisions about sponsorships, so contact them directly. In the case of smaller businesses, you'll want to reach out to the owner or general manager.\n\n\n\nWhat?&nbsp;\u2013 Give a brief description of your event (including the planned date and location) and its goals.\n\n\n\nWhy?&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;This is the most important part of your email. Tell them why they should sponsor your event. This initial email is not the place to focus on yourself or a specific dollar amount, but rather what your prospective sponsor will be getting out of the partnership. Be as specific as possible about what you can deliver.\n\n\n\nHow?&nbsp;\u2013 Show the organization that you've chosen them for a reason and that you have a solid understanding of what they do. Give them a taste of the ideas you have in mind for this partnership and they'll see that you've put some thought into your decision to reach out to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep your letter short and sweet, including only the most important details. That way, you'll have more luck in getting sponsors for your event to read your entire email. Also, consider your audience when determining the tone of your email. You want to be polite and friendly, but there's no need to be overly formal \u2014 especially if you're reaching out to someone you already know.\n\n\n\nStarting a relationship with your sponsor\n\n\n\nYou emailed everyone on your list and all that hard work paid off \u2014 you got a response! Now it's time to grow that relationship. If possible, try to meet with them face-to-face, ideally in person or through a video call. To help ensure this meeting is a success, prepare the pitch for your&nbsp;sponsorship proposal&nbsp;as well as your answers to anticipated questions about it. This might include pricing options, event logistics about where their logo and name will be seen, or how the sponsor will benefit from working with your event. Having an&nbsp;event day checklist&nbsp;can make this discussion easier as well. To help, here are the top questions your sponsors will want answered:\n\n\n\nWhat is the cost per reach? (And what does that mean?)\n\n\n\n\u200dThe total cost of sponsoring your event is important, but sponsors are more interested in how much they are paying per attendee. The more aligned your attendees are with their target demographic, the more potential sponsors will be willing to spend.\n\n\n\nWhat are the additional costs in sponsoring your event?\n\n\n\nTo make the most out of this partnership, sponsors need to spend more than just the check they write to your event. When sponsors spend money on independently promoting and marketing sponsorships, that's called sponsorship activation. This includes finding\u00a0PR opportunities\u00a0before the event,\u00a0giving out swag, displaying banners at the event, and building a booth. Showing that you're aware of these activation costs is reassuring to sponsors.\n\n\n\nDoes your event match their company's core values?\n\n\n\nOne of a business owner's priorities is to uphold their company's values and ensure their partners do the same. This sponsorship proposal is your chance to demonstrate how your organization's unique story aligns with those values and how your audience matches their target market.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAre there any indirect benefits?\n\n\n\nIf a company sponsors your event, consider offering some added bonuses in return for helping you. For example, you could give away free tickets or backstage passes to meet your performers or celebrity guests. They could pass these perks onto their VIP clients too, extending the effectiveness of their sponsorship.\n\n\n\nMaking those relationships last\n\n\n\nOnce you've scored your sponsorships (congrats!) and your event has come and gone, sponsors will be thinking about how beneficial their partnership with you was, and whether they'd like to invest more in the future. Did you give them what you promised? Did they gain contacts of potential new customers thanks to your event? Did you follow up with them right after the event?\n\n\n\nAs the event organizer, it's your responsibility to ensure your sponsors will be taken care of well after your big day is over. Keep in touch with them to show you appreciate their business and in case they'd like to support your other events in the future. As part of your&nbsp;post-event strategy, send them an occasional email during your event's off-season (like around the holidays) to keep you in the back of their minds. This'll make reaching back out to them for another sponsorship easier. With these established relationships, you'll know exactly how to find sponsors for an event in the future!\n","date":"16 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6205306eaf8a44b2540b6f8d_find-event-sponsors-cover-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

When your doors finally open, even the smallest details can have a big impact on your success, from communication plans, to hydration stations, to parking. Want to make sure you have everything complete and accounted for? You've come to the right place! Our team has put together an event day checklist to double-check that you have all the essentials covered before the big day.\n\n\n\nDownload our full checklist\u00a0today to use as a reference guide during your event preparations!\n\n\n\n1. Check in with your team\n\n\n\nMeet with your entire&nbsp;event staff&nbsp;(including volunteers!) at the beginning of the day to confirm all hands are on deck.&nbsp;Go over key topics&nbsp;like your admissions strategy, security details, emergency plans, and your full event schedule so everyone knows what to expect throughout the day. And be sure to give everyone easy access to your event schedule, whether as digital or hard copies, so they can check what's going on at any time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Meet with your vendors and special guests\n\n\n\nMake time to touch base with each of your third-party vendors, special guests, and&nbsp;media personnel, ensuring they're clear on their role for the day and your expectations of them. This can include reviewing your shot list with your photographer, clarifying what sized bags your security team will allow in, or discussing the event schedule with your special guests. You can even go above and beyond by providing them with personalized itineraries for event day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Solidify your communication plan with staff\n\n\n\nNo matter the size of your event, clear communication between team members is key to successful event operations. Establish where and how you'll be doing your main communicating, whether it be via walkie-talkies, in-ears, text, or a group messaging app like Slack or Discord. We also highly recommend laying out a role hierarchy so each staff member knows who to go to with questions or escalations. For this, it's key to clarify not only who everyone's main point of contact is, but also secondary contacts for emergencies. Share these contacts with all staff.\n\n\n\n4. Check the WiFi\n\n\n\nYou can never verify your WiFi connection too often! If large crowds of attendees use your WiFi at once, it's not uncommon for your connection to slow down or become unstable. That's why you need to have a clear backup plan in case of temporary outages, which can include setting up mobile hotspots or connecting to a nearby building's WiFi. If you're really in a pinch, plugging into an ethernet cord is a great way to ensure stable internet connection for your most important devices. Whatever your solution is, make sure you're password protecting your data all the time!\n\n\n\n5. Confirm weather-dependent accommodations\n\n\n\nThe weather can be unpredictable, so it's vital to remain flexible for event day. If you're hosting an outdoor event, make sure you're prepared for every type of weather condition. This could include purchasing heaters, fans, tents, or ponchos, or moving your event indoors. If plans do change, be sure to update your attendees and staff as soon as possible. Even if you've planned to be at an indoor venue all along, while it may seem obvious, you should check that your A\/V, air conditioning, and heating systems are all working properly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Finalize your admissions strategy\n\n\n\nThe key to minimizing event queuing is having a solid admissions strategy and sticking to it. Prior to your event, plan how you'll direct the lines to maximize floor space and clearly differentiate between different lines (like VIP, box office, and mobile check-in) using stanchions, floor tape, or spray paint if you're outside. Have staff stationed at your entrances to help approaching customers get to the right check-in line. Lastly, verify all your exits and entrances are easily accessible and visible. If you're expecting a larger crowd, consider setting up more entry points to get your attendees in as fast as possible!\n\n\n\n7. Test all event tech\n\n\n\nTesting your event technology is crucial to ensuring your admissions will run as smoothly as possible. First, verify that all your scanners, card readers, phones, and walkie-talkies are fully charged and working properly. Then, set aside time for every staff member to test scanning tickets, manually looking up orders, and making payments at the door. Pro-tip: keep backup chargers and extra batteries handy for an extra power boost if you need it!\n\n\n\n8. Set up clear event signage\n\n\n\nEnsure all your event signage is on display and clearly labeled for key places like concessions, your service desk, bathrooms, water stations, and your exits and entrances. Set out&nbsp;sponsored display ads&nbsp;and signs to their booths in high-traffic areas of your venue for maximum attention. And don't forget to upload your entire venue layout on your website or mobile app so your attendees can easily reference it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9. Communicate your parking plan\n\n\n\nWith proper planning, you can make parking a painless part of your event day experience. Before cars pull in, set up signs to your parking lot and station staff to direct traffic and maximize your lot space. You'll also want to designate a preferred parking area for VIPs, special guests, and reporters. Make sure you clearly communicate if there's a parking fee and accepted payments (cash, credit, etc.), and know where the closest ATM is just in case.\n\n\n\n10. Gather additional supplies\n\n\n\nSome of the smallest details can make all the difference later! For example, keep a basic tool kit on hand to give your equipment some quick TLC at a moment's notice. Check that you have extra extension cords and some gaffer tape to cover any stray cords across the floor. And, most importantly, have a basic first aid kit close by for minor injuries. After all, safety first!\n\n\n\n11. Take care of yourself and others!\n\n\n\nWith how many hats you wear as an event organizer, remember to practice some self-care. This includes (but is not limited to) staying hydrated, making time to grab a cup of coffee, getting enough sleep the night before, and wearing comfortable shoes! And don't forget to look out for your fellow staff members and make sure they're taking care of themselves, too. Remember: you're all in this together!\n\n\n\nLook at that, you've made it! If you follow this day of event checklist and&nbsp;our full event planning checklist, you'll gain more peace of mind than ever that all your operations are accounted for. If you're working with an online ticketing platform like&nbsp;TicketLeap, you'll even have a&nbsp;friendly support team by your side to help with any event questions you may have.\n\n\n\nAnd don't forget to\u00a0download a\u00a0printable version of this checklist\u00a0to use during your big day!\n","date":"16 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/62ebc598565918308868ec37_tl-event-day-checklist-OPTED-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

You don't need a huge budget to build buzz. Check out our top eight tips to increase ticket sales without spending a dime.\n\n\n\n1. Write a great event description\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nSure, you're excited about your event, but why should your potential attendees be? A good\u00a0event description\u00a0answers that question. It should be both informative (date, time, etc.) and compelling. So go ahead and get creative! Put yourself in their shoes, think about how you want your event to make them feel, and let your words mirror that emotion. Include some version of this description on your event page, social media profiles, and anywhere else you're talking about your event.\n\n\n\n2. Share your event URL everywhere to boost ticket sales\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nOne of the many benefits of using a ticketing platform is that it gives you the ability to create a beautiful, professional-looking event page in minutes. This means that you also have a custom URL to share on social media to promote your event and sell tickets online easily and securely. If you know where your audience likes to hang out online, you're all set to start promoting.\n\n\n\nShare your event page link on X, in your Instagram bio, and anywhere else your potential attendees can be found. If your organization has a Facebook group, share your link there and encourage your followers to share it with their audience, too.\n\n\n\n3. Create the perfect hashtag\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nA custom hashtag is a valuable resource when it comes to boosting your event ticket sales. It's a great way for your past, present, and future attendees to find your event across almost any social media platform. Choose a hashtag that's catchy, relevant, and unique. Use your hashtag in all of your marketing efforts and encourage your attendees to do the same. That way, when they share&nbsp;fun photos from your event, it's easy to find them later (especially when you need photos to promote your future events).\n\n\n\n4. Find sponsors your audience will love\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nSponsorships help increase your ticket revenue because they add value to your event without requiring you to spend extra money. This means you can increase your&nbsp;ticket price&nbsp;and your attendees will still feel they're getting a bang for their buck. Some sponsorships are monetary donations, which allows you to increase your budget from previous events in whatever way will delight your audience the most: a swankier venue, a celebrity guest, or a great DJ.\n\n\n\nOther sponsorships involve donations of goods or services, like a restaurant providing lunch at no cost, or a company providing volunteers to staff your event. In return, your sponsors' brand gets a presence at your event so they can grow their audience as well. Win-win!\n\n\n\n5. Blog about your event\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nIf your organization has a blog, post about your event in the weeks leading up to the big day. Be sure to link to your event page in these and other blog posts. If you don't have a blog, try reaching out to bloggers with an audience that would be interested in your event. For example, if your event is family-friendly, a local parenting blogger would be the perfect person to reach out to. Keep your message short, concise, and genuine. Include their name in the salutation so it doesn't feel spammy or impersonal, and only reach out if you think their audience is truly a good match for your event.\n\n\n\n6. Build your community\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nWe already mentioned sharing your event page link on social media, but don't forget to go deeper and find online communities that would be interested in your event. Join Facebook groups, subreddits, and neighborhood\/local groups that are relevant to the theme of your event.&nbsp;Post about your event&nbsp;in these groups, but also make a point to check out other group members' posts and comment and interact with them. It's a great way to increase event ticket sales and build some real relationships at the same time.\n\n\n\n7. Take advantage of limited-time offers\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nHave you ever added an item to your cart while shopping online, only to click away before actually buying it? If so, you'll understand how adding a sense of urgency can drive sales. When setting up your event page, create early bird tickets that are priced lower than your regular tickets and only available for a limited time. Promote this early bird deal on social media, and be sure to let your audience know that the offer ends soon. (Note: TicketLeap\u2019s platform always includes multiple ticket types, while other ticketing platforms may charge more for this option. Keep this in mind if you\u2019re shopping around.) \n\n\n\n8. Don't forget about in-person opportunities\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\nSometimes, nothing compares to a face-to-face interaction. Network at events similar to yours, or any events with a shared audience. Keep business cards on hand with links to your social media profiles and event page, and your event hashtag. (Don't go bigger than a business card. People are less inclined to hold on to anything that's too large to tuck into their wallets.) If you know what stores or restaurants your audience frequents, leave flyers there.

After all, first impressions are extremely important! You'll want the description of your event to be so compelling that they can't help but buy their tickets. To help you with this, we've got some tips on how to write an event description that'll drive you more ticket sales.\n\n\n\nThere's buzz going around about your upcoming event \u2013 awesome! You're super close to scoring that ticket sale and seeing that new attendee at your next event. Now the real fun starts! Once they reach your&nbsp;event listing&nbsp;and get serious about buying tickets, you'll want to make sure you have all the important info displayed accurately and looking great. And that all starts with your event's description!\n\n\n\n6 best practices for a successful event description\n\n\n\nHaving a vibrant description of your event is something you'll want to have squared away before you&nbsp;launch your ticket sales. Let's dive into how to describe an event on various platforms (whether that be on your ticketing page, website, or social media) in the most compelling way possible!\n\n\n\n1. Be specific\n\n\n\nThis first step is by far the most important. Communicate all the important info about your event to your readers. This'll create the firm foundation you'll build your description off of. To start, make an outline of all the essential info you need to cover. This may include:\n\n\n\n\nEvent date(s)\n\n\n\nEvent start and end time(s)\n\n\n\nLocation (or where you'll stream from if it's a&nbsp;virtual event)\n\n\n\nNotable guests, instructors, lineup, or activities\n\n\n\nBasic agenda\n\n\n\nYour refund policy\n\n\n\nAny age restrictions, especially if you're&nbsp;serving alcohol\n\n\n\nDress code\n\n\n\nProtocol in case of bad weather\n\n\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, your event description should answer the questions \u201cwho?\u201d, \u201cwhat?\u201d, \u201cwhen?\u201d, \u201cwhere?\u201d,&nbsp; and \u201cwhy?\u201d of your event. For any info that's more in the weeds (like parking or what to bring), you can always direct people to your website or send them further details via email leading up to&nbsp;your event day.\n\n\n\n2. Get people excited\n\n\n\nHighlight what makes your event unique and a must-see opportunity! This is called your unique value proposition or UVP. You'll want to answer the question \u201cso what?\u201d, especially for potential customers who're on the fence. Why is it worth spending time and money to come to your event? Why should people go to your event versus staying home or going somewhere else that day?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs you're writing, let your personality shine through, and don't be afraid to play off people's emotions a bit (whether that be excitement or a little FOMO). When possible, you should definitely feature high-quality&nbsp;and videos from previous events to drive home how awesome it's going to be too.\n\n\n\n3. Sprinkle in social proof\n\n\n\nWant to take your event description up a notch? Incorporating social proof can make your event more appealing, especially once you back up how awesome it's going to be. Have you sold out your event in the past? Mention that! Add a brief bio about the accomplishments of the most notable guest speakers or artists in your lineup. Consider sharing estimated attendance numbers based on previous years, if you have them (maybe something like, \u201cour art fair is one of the largest cultural events in the area, with an average annual attendance of more than 15,000 people\u201d). Highlighting who's&nbsp;sponsoring your event&nbsp;will amp up your credibility as well. Maybe even use testimonials from past attendees or guest speakers, talking about their personal experience at your event.\n\n\n\n4. Ensure it's SEO-friendly\n\n\n\nAs part of&nbsp;your SEO efforts, you'll definitely want to incorporate keywords related to your event's location, general topic, and the year. For example, if you're hosting a fall festival in Columbus, Ohio, you'll want to include keywords like \u201cfestivals in Columbus,\u201d \u201cColumbus fall festivals,\u201d etc. Incorporate your organization's name, notable guest names, and any other terms people may search for. You'll also want to write slight variations of your event description for the different online locations it might be posted in. Each platform is different, so your descriptions should be slightly different too!\n\n\n\n5. Make it easy to read\n\n\n\nIn reality, most people will skim your description, so you'll want to make it as easy for them absorb all your important info as they do. How do you do that? By being concise! Rather than using huge blocks of text, write in bite-sized paragraphs. This is better for mobile devices too, which is important since most people are viewing from their phones nowadays. Should your description need to be longer, include headers and bulleted or numbered lists for easier readability.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Mold your description to the platform\n\n\n\nHot take, not all platforms are created equal! As you craft your event description, think about how you'll modify it for your website, your&nbsp;Facebook event listing, and (most importantly!) your ticketing page. Length will vary depending on what's best for the platform you're using as part of your&nbsp;marketing strategy&nbsp;(i.e., website, socials, ticketing page, etc.). For example, your ticketing page should be pretty detailed, but your website should go even more in depth to address specific questions. On the other hand, keep your description brief for social media, piquing their interest with the high points and directing people to your website or ticketing page to learn more.\n\n\n\nPro tip: Looking for some extra help?

For you, they're a powerful way to fuel your event's experiences and boost your bottom line. For your sponsors, they're the key to tapping into new audiences and driving more business to their company. An irresistible sponsorship package is the cornerstone to creating a dynamic event duo! To help you get started, here are our tips on sponsorship packages that'll turn your sponsorship pitch into a long-lasting relationship.\n\n\n\nWhat are event sponsorship packages?\n\n\n\nAn event sponsorship package is the bundle of perks an individual or business gains in exchange for supporting your event. This package should be put together before your initial contact with prospective sponsors, since this will be your starting point for negotiations. Ideally, event sponsorship packages add value and visibility to your sponsor, while giving your event additional credibility, increased budget, and an enhanced guest experience. In other words, it's a win-win opportunity for both of you!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUltimately, a sponsor's primary goal is to gain a return on their investment (or ROI). Therefore, your sponsorship package should showcase all the ways this deal will benefit them. You may grant them various opportunities like new customer leads, access to attendee data, exposure to new audiences, brand placements, booth space, or speaking opportunities at your event.\n\n\n\nThe key is to first conduct your research to&nbsp;find the perfect sponsors, ones whose brand aligns with yours. Then, when pitching your package, you'll be able to show them exactly why the two of you are the right fit.\n\n\n\nTwo main types of sponsorship packages\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into how to make one, let's go over the two primary types of sponsorship for events. This'll help you decide what's best for your event's needs!\n\n\n\nTiered sponsorships\n\n\n\nThis type of sponsorship allows you to bundle your available opportunities at different price points to best suit your sponsor's budget. Tiers are great at conveying exclusivity, paving a clear path towards ROI, and making the decision-making process simpler. We recommend using a naming convention for your tiers that accurately reflects the benefits of each. You may consider basing them off your event's theme or go with a classic approach like having platinum, gold, silver, and bronze tiers.\n\n\n\nA la carte sponsorships\n\n\n\nLooking for an even more customizable approach to your sponsorship packages? Build out your full list of perks for sponsors to choose from. That way, they can pick exactly what they want. This is also an effective option for sponsors who may want to offer other things like giveaway items or free food in exchange for a sponsorship.\n\n\n\nHow to build your sponsorship package\n\n\n\nAlright, so you've got a solid grasp on what event sponsorship packages are. Now, let's go step by step through the various elements of crafting your dream sponsorship package!\n\n\n\n1. Kick off with your event's value proposition\n\n\n\nRight off the bat, you want to showcase your event's unique value proposition (or UVP) in the introduction of your sponsorship package. Why are you the perfect partner to sponsor with? What makes you stand out? Why should they choose you over another event? Highlight your event's reach, reputation, and community impact, on top of anything else that'll help shine the spotlight on you, your event, and your goals. Be sure to share essential details about your event like the date, time, and location too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Outline your audience size and demographics\n\n\n\nHard numbers are essential for proving that your event taps into your sponsor's target audience. In your sponsorship package, outline&nbsp;compelling metrics&nbsp;on how many people typically attend your events and what the demographics of your attendees look like. If you've used TicketLeap's intuitive software before, you can easily pull reports on past attendance numbers or use answers from your&nbsp;custom registration questions&nbsp;to learn more about your attendees. You could also go above and beyond by sharing a breakdown of your social media following, your average number of website visitors, or the total recipients of your newsletter. As a rule of thumb, the more specific numbers you can present, the better. That way, the data will convince sponsors for you!\n\n\n\n3. Highlight your sponsorship opportunities\n\n\n\nThis is the bread and butter of your sponsorship package! Dedicate the bulk of your sponsorship deck to clearly showcasing your complete smorgasbord of opportunities. If you're presenting your packages as tiers, consider displaying them in a table to clearly delineate between what they'll get for various price points. The key here is to be as clear and detailed in your communication as possible. Looking for some extra inspiration on what to offer potential sponsors? We've included a list of 10 irresistible sponsorship package examples near the end of this blog to help you!\n\n\n\n4. Showcase your sponsorship's benefits\n\n\n\nAlongside your more technical list of opportunities, you'll need to emphasize the potential ROI associated with them. This could include gaining exposure in high-traffic areas of your event, leads for new customers, new traffic to their website, or revenue from selling their products onsite. You should also highlight how your opportunities foster quality connections between sponsors and attendees, from encouraging conversations at their booth, hosting interactive workshops, or giving live product demos. To add extra credibility and make your offer even more persuasive, you can also level up your package with featured case studies and\/or testimonials from past sponsors, talking about what a great experience it was to work alongside you!\n\n\n\n5. Design your sponsorship package with compelling visuals\n\n\n\nHow your sponsorship package looks is equally as important as the content within it. Present your package in a sleek, professional way that incorporates your event's branding and logos throughout the pages. Include colorful visual aids like charts and graphs to illustrate your demographic breakdowns and your list of opportunities. Feature&nbsp;high-quality event photos&nbsp;throughout, plus add headers, subheaders, and bulleted lists to make it easier to read at a glance. For putting this all together in a slide deck or .pdf, programs like Google Slides, Adobe Illustrator, and Canva will be your best friend! There's also plenty of templates available online if you'd like to use one as your starting point.\n\n\n\n6. Include your contact info\n\n\n\nMaybe this goes without saying, but be sure to include your name (and\/or the name of whomever handles sponsorships on your&nbsp;event staff), email, and phone number into your sponsorship deck. Consider adding this on the first page, in the footer, and\/or the last page of your sponsorship deck for any follow up questions. This simple yet essential step will ensure the conversation can keep on going!\n\n\n\n10 event sponsorship perks to include\n\n\n\nAt the heart of an enticing event sponsorship package is a list of opportunities that'll resonate with your audience. The key is to not only gain exposure to your sponsor's brand, but to have attendees genuinely engage with it. To help bolster your list of offerings, we've got some intriguing ideas that both your sponsors and your attendees will love!\n\n\n\n1. Sponsored VIP experiences\n\n\n\nSponsoring backstage events is sure to make your sponsor the talk of the town! Depending on what your event is, you could offer meet &amp; greets with your special guests, pre-show performances from your performers, exclusive Q&amp;A or networking sessions, or a behind-the-scenes tour of your&nbsp;haunted attraction.\n\n\n\n2. Speaking opportunities\n\n\n\nLet your sponsors share the spotlight at your event with opportunities to present to your attendees. Watch them shine as they share their industry knowledge and stories in a panel, lecture, or workshop about a topic they're passionate about!\n\n\n\n3. Art installations\n\n\n\nBuild an&nbsp;Instagram-worthy&nbsp;backdrop for your attendees to pose and take pictures with! As some ideas, you could have a backdrop covered in flowers, balloons, or string lights with their logo prominently displayed in the background. You could even consider creating a&nbsp;sustainable art installation&nbsp;out of recycled materials like refurbished doors or streamers of reused fabric.\n\n\n\n4. Branded swag\n\n\n\nEveryone loves free stuff! The key with these freebies is to give attendees something they'll find super useful, making your sponsor even more memorable as attendees continue to use it well after your event. For example, if your event is outdoors in the summer, a company could put their logo and information on free fans or water bottles you could hand out to attendees to cool off with. Your sponsors could also sponsor\u00a0swag bags\u00a0or items inside of them. Feel free to get imaginative, and really think outside the box!\n\n\n\n5. Giveaways\n\n\n\nConnect your sponsors and your attendees together with giveaways featuring valuable items from your sponsor! As part of your&nbsp;event marketing efforts, you could host a giveaway on social media where your followers can enter to win if they tag friends in the comments and follow your sponsor. You could do raffles onsite too, with exclusive prizes for your ticket buyers!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Online brand placements\n\n\n\nYou could have your sponsor appear in a prominent place on your website or your mobile app, as a partner on your&nbsp;Facebook event page, or as a collaborator on your Instagram posts. You could also host a&nbsp;live stream on TikTok, Facebook, or Instagram featuring your sponsor. On your stream, you chat with them about their work in the community and at your event, do an interactive workshop, or play fun games (as just a few ideas). These are great efforts to include alongside our social media giveaway idea above!\n\n\n\n7. Photo booth or backdrop\n\n\n\nLet your attendees have a blast in a photo booth provided by your sponsor! You could include their branding on the props attendees can wear or hold up when posing for their photos. You could place the sponsor's logo on the corner of the photos printed out from the booth too. If you're hosting a more formal event like a&nbsp;fundraising gala&nbsp;or film festival, try displaying your sponsors' logos on a large backdrop behind them as they walk a red carpet and get their picture taken!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Food\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love some free food? Have your sponsor provide a catered meal during your event, or to satisfy your attendees' sweet tooth, you could also offer branded cupcakes or cookies that are sure to impress! This is especially perfect for potential restaurants, bakeries, or other food-related companies you may partner with.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9. Booths\n\n\n\nOffer your sponsor a designated booth space to show off what their company is all about and encourage on-the-ground conversations with your attendees (aka, their future customers!). You could even incorporate a scavenger hunt or another kind of game into your event to encourage guests to visit your sponsor's booth to win some prizes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n10. Sponsored live stream\n\n\n\nTake your event global with a&nbsp;live stream&nbsp;of your in-person event, provided by your sponsor. Incorporate their branding before and during the stream, have your sponsor engage with your virtual audience via polls and live chat, and add a call-to-action link to make their company's site easily accessible.\n\n\n\n\u200d\n\n\n\nThere you have it! You're now fully equipped to build a stellar event sponsorship package of your own. Be intentional with further discussing your opportunities with potential sponsorships in person, over the phone, or through a video call. Ultimately, you can pitch to your prospective sponsors with confidence, knowing your event's sponsorship package will let them shine!\n","date":"10 Oct 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6512ed862331afa141929b3f_two-businessmen-high-fiving-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

If you provide attendees with branded items that have everyday practical use, those attendees could turn into a walking\u00a0promotion for your event\u00a0whenever they use them. Attention-grabbing items can spark conversations, causing people to unexpectedly promote your event and brand image. Not to mention, gifting an event swag bag will be sure to make your attendees feel even more appreciated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n4 ways to source budget-friendly swag bag items\n\n\n\nA lot of times for organizers, event swag bags are sure to add a valuable touch but may be a challenge to execute, depending on your budget. Since staying within your budget is a crucial part of event success, here are four ways to source swag bag items cost-effectively to make gifting them to your attendees more feasible!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Research suppliers\n\n\n\nDo your due diligence when researching suppliers! Look for companies that offer competitive pricing for the types of swag items you're looking for without sacrificing quality. Reading&nbsp;reviews can ensure reliability and customer satisfaction with the company's ability to customize as the buyer intended. For some ideas, you may consider&nbsp;Swag, SwagMagic, or&nbsp;SwagUp&nbsp;as potential suppliers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Bulk order\n\n\n\nSome suppliers may offer bulk discounts if you order larger quantities of swag items. By taking advantage of these promotional offers, you can help reduce the unit cost and\u00a0maximize your budget!\n\n\n\n3. Collaborate with sponsors\n\n\n\nReach out to\u00a0your sponsors! Consider ways you could collaborate with them to provide swag items. For example, you could include some free samples of their products into your swag bags. This allows you to provide goodies for your attendees, while saving you money and offering\u00a0sponsorship opportunities\u00a0that creatively promote their company too!\n\n\n\n4. Simplify packaging&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo help minimize costs where you can, try simplifying your packaging so you can focus on the items within your swag bags. Opt for cost-effective packaging options like kraft bags and tissue paper.\n\n\n\n6 fresh swag bag ideas&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt's no secret that people love free stuff! That said, since swag bags have been around for some time, you may want to think outside the box so your freebies will be even more memorable than the more classic items. Shake things up with the following event swag ideas to surprise your attendees with unexpected items that'll leave a lasting impression!\n\n\n\n1. Self-care products&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEncourage attendees to make self-care a priority by incorporating wellness products into their event swag bag! Aromatherapy candles, stress balls, mini massagers, bath bombs, or even a meditation journal are all awesome ideas to promote\u00a0mindfulness at your events.\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. Eco-friendly items\n\n\n\nPracticing\u00a0event sustainability\u00a0not only helps our environment's well-being, it also shows your brand's commitment to eco-consciousness and encourages your attendees to do the same. As part of your efforts, offer sustainable swag items like reusable water bottles, eco-friendly notebooks, biodegradable tote bags, or even bamboo utensil sets! Pro tip: If you're creating corporate swag bag ideas, bamboo utensil sets are a great addition so your employees can use them on their lunch breaks!\n\n\n\n3. Customized apparel&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncluding customized apparel and accessories like t-shirts, hats, bracelets, or socks (everyone loves socks) will transform your attendees into walking event promo! This way attendees can show their affiliation and foster brand loyalty, all while creating a sense of exclusivity. Get creative with your logo placements and curate a piece that can easily fit into an individual's wardrobe so they're sure to wear it often!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Tech gadgets&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdd a modern touch to your swag items with tech gadgets and accessories like mini Bluetooth speakers, portable chargers, or tiny trackers to help you find your lost keys. These items are both useful and super convenient!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Gourmet goodies\n\n\n\nFood is always a crowd-pleaser and will give your attendees a memorable taste of your event! Consider adding artisan chocolates, mini snacks, candy, or gum to your swag bag. Go the extra mile if you can and customize the packaging of your chosen goodies for a more personal touch!\n\n\n\n6. Virtual gifts\n\n\n\nVirtual swag bag ideas are an unconventional way to gift your attendees from a distance! On top of traditional items like e-gift cards or coupons, you could think about providing attendees of your&nbsp;virtual event&nbsp;with a beneficial subscription or free link to a virtual fitness class, online wine tasting, e-books, or even a cooking class.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHanding out your swag bags&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are a few ways you can handle distributing your swag bags at your event. For one, you could have a designated swag bag pickup area near your registration desk or check-in station where attendees can collect their bags as they walk in. This allows you to impress them from the moment they arrive, plus they can put other things in their bag throughout your event day too. As another option, your staff or volunteers could hand out swag bags directly to attendees during a specific time while your event is underway. You could also set up a booth inside your venue for attendees to grab their bags while browsing around, after your main activities wrap up, or as they get ready to leave. We recommend implementing a mixture of these methods, depending on the layout of your event!\n\n\n\nReady to put together a swag bag for your next event?

Thrill-seekers everywhere are more ready than ever to put their courage to the test at your attraction, so you need to be sure you're using the right ticketing features. And TicketLeap is here to help! Read on for our event experts' eight event ticketing features you need to pull off your biggest scare yet.\n\n\n\n1. Branded haunt event pages\n\n\n\nFirst up: You need a fully branded event page that gives your customers an easy ticket buying experience while showing them all the most important info about your haunt. Your ticketing platform should make it simple to create a spooky-looking event page that works on any device, and is easily customizable&nbsp;so you can quickly start selling haunt tickets online!\n\n\n\n2. Timed entry for your haunted house\n\n\n\nBeyond general admission pricing, your event ticketing platform needs to have timed ticketing for haunted attractions. Why, you may ask? Because being able to control capacity throughout the day for your haunt is the key to a successful season. With TicketLeap, you can control how many people are in your event by selling tickets at individual time slots separated by minutes, hours, or days. Plus, with our bulk editing tool, you can update important info (like ticket prices and event details) across your haunt's dates and times instantly!\n\n\n\n3. Sell tickets online and onsite\n\n\n\nWhile selling tickets online is your bread and butter, you definitely need to have scary simple ticketing at the gate, too. Those onsite ticket sales can add a nice boost to your annual revenue! If you're already using an event ticketing platform, make sure you can easily manage cash and card payments at the door.\n\n\n\n4. Built-in waivers and registration\n\n\n\nAdd custom waivers and registration questions right into your checkout process for a scary easy way to collect the customer information you desire most. Plus, not only will you be able to forewarn attendees of the screams and scares they'll experience at your haunt, you'll speed up the onsite check-in process ten-fold!\n\n\n\n5. Ticketing scanning app\n\n\n\nIf you've ever attended a haunted house or other Halloween event, you know the pain of slow-moving check-in lines. So you want to make sure you partner up with a ticketing platform that provides you with a free ticket scanner app that allows you to check in your next victims at lightning-fast speed and sell additional tickets at the gate (like TicketLeap!)\n\n\n\n6. Built-in marketing tools\n\n\n\nA ticketing platform worthy of working with your haunt will have the tools to help you manage your entire marketing campaign. For example, your platform should let you add custom messaging to your ticket confirmation emails to share important event details and thank your customers for their purchase. You should also be able to send email blasts to attendees before and after your haunt, share news or discounts with your social media audience, and so much more!\n\n\n\n7. Smart reporting\n\n\n\nDiscover more about your customers, like their location and interests, and use that information to take your haunted attraction to the next level. By connecting services like Google Analytics, you'll learn exactly where haunt-seekers are coming from and what they're most excited for, so you can give them an event experience they'll never forget (even in their nightmares).\n\n\n\n8. Friendly support\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to support, every ticketing platform is not created equal. You need a friendly and experienced team ready to answer all of your questions. If you need help setting up your event listing, want to talk strategy for your admissions, or determine how your ticketing platform can best suit your event\u2019s unique needs, you deserve an expert team by your side.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right ticketing platform for haunted attractions\n\n\n\nWhen you're looking for an event ticketing system with the right features to support you this haunt season, choose an easy-to-use event ticketing platform with simple, straightforward pricing like TicketLeap!

You\u2019ve come to the right place! Event-goers are more excited than ever for a fun, engaging event experience, so you need to make the most of that excitement by promoting your event to as many potential ticket buyers as possible. Dive into our team\u2019s event marketing tips designed to help you maximize ticket sales, get your event in front of more people, and keep your attendees coming back for more.\n\n\n\nWhy does event marketing matter?\n\n\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: what is event marketing, and how can it help your business? It\u2019s simple! Event marketing is how you spread the word about your event. This can range from asking your friends and family to share it with others, to posting on social media, to developing a multi-pronged digital marketing campaign. Essentially, it\u2019s your chance to connect with potential attendees in a way that makes sense for your business.\n\n\n\nBuilding a marketing strategy is a key step in preparing for your event and will play a big part in your overall success. You could secure your venue, plan your programming, set up a ticketing page, and more; however, until you market the event, no one is going to know to come!\n\n\n\nWhat does successful marketing for events look like? Show people how awesome your event is and all the ways they'd benefit from attending! As you'll learn through this guide, every time you showcase your upcoming event to people, you're drawing them closer and closer to finally buying their tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the marketing funnel can help\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the marketing funnel is like having a roadmap to create a foolproof marketing strategy for your event. Everyone who interacts with your events\u2019 marketing falls into one of five categories \u2014 awareness, interest, consideration, action, or advocacy \u2014 and knowing where they are in the funnel helps you meet them with the right message at the right time. From broadest to narrowest, here's a summary of each level of the event marketing funnel and what they're about:\n\n\n\n\nAwareness = gaining exposure for your event and getting in front of people so they recognize you\n\n\n\nInterest = introducing who you are and letting people know what your events are all about\n\n\n\nConsideration = providing additional information and reasons to attend for those who are seriously considering if it\u2019s worth coming to your event\n\n\n\nAction = getting people to convert into paying customers (like purchasing tickets!)\n\n\n\nAdvocacy = encouraging their friends about you and coming to your events year after year\n\n\n\n\nThe key is to craft a strategy that taps into all these levels because it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all process. Some potential attendees may need a bit more convincing than others, and that\u2019s okay! Using a mix of marketing channels, like social media for awareness or email campaigns for consideration, ensures you're speaking effectively to people in different stages. While not every marketing effort will result in an immediate ticket sale, every touchpoint nudges someone closer to attending your event. By viewing the big picture and tailoring your approach, you'll create a strategy that inspires action and builds loyal fans for your events!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I measure the success of my event marketing?\n\n\n\nBefore you dive into the nitty-gritty of your event marketing plan, you need to determine specific and achievable goals you want to reach, along with how to measure those goals. To do this, set up key performance indicators (KPIs). Basically, KPIs are targets for your team to shoot for, or milestones to gauge your progress towards a larger goal. As your marketing efforts progress, you can use KPIs to measure how they\u2019re performing and how they\u2019re contributing to your overall goal. Then, use that data to make adjustments to your campaigns as you go.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThroughout this article, we\u2019ll include KPIs to consider for each marketing channel, so you can evaluate what\u2019s working and what needs improvement to help maximize your ticket sales. And remember, success will look different depending on your goals and the purpose of each channel based on the marketing funnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the essential channels for my event marketing strategy?\n\n\n\nA powerful event marketing strategy starts with selecting the right mix of channels to spread the word and excite your audience. Diversifying your channels \u2014 like leveraging social media for eye-catching posts, using email campaigns to directly engage with your most loyal followers, and collaborating with partners or influencers to tap into new audiences \u2014 maximizes your reach. While there are even more channels out here, here are the channels we'll dive more into throughout this guide:\n\n\n\n\nSocial media\n\n\n\nEmail campaigns\n\n\n\nYour event website\n\n\n\nYour ticketing page\n\n\n\nReferral incentives\n\n\n\nPublic relations\n\n\n\nTraditional marketing\n\n\n\nSponsorships\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it so critical to tap into each of these? Because people usually need to hear about your event multiple times, and often in different ways, before deciding to buy tickets. A mix of platforms ensures that your event stays top-of-mind, no matter how someone likes to consume content. The result? More visibility, stronger connections, and a much higher chance of filling those seats!\n\n\n\n1. Social media\n\n\n\n\nImportance: When it comes to drumming up hype for your event, never underestimate the power of social media! All throughout the year, and especially leading up to your event, you should be posting regularly on your Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and other social media profiles. Your event\u2019s social media marketing presence should give them a taste of your unique onsite experiences. This includes posting high-quality photos and videos with short, catchy captions. Then, after your customers buy tickets, keep the engagement going and turn them into free brand ambassadors when they share your event to their own social profiles!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): All levels, but especially Awareness and Interest\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nEngagement rate: Measures the level of interaction with your posts (likes, comments, shares, etc.), showing how well your content resonates with your audience.\n\n\n\nClick-through rate (CTR): The percentage of people who clicked on your event link after seeing your social media post, helping you gauge how effective your call-to-action is.\n\n\n\nFollower growth: Tracks how your social media following grows leading up to your big day, reflecting the overall interest and awareness of your event.\n\n\n\nHashtag performance: Measures how often your event\u2019s branded hashtags are used, which can give insight into how far your event's social reach is and how many attendees are making content of their own about your event.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nMaintain a regular posting schedule across all your social media channels (e.g., Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn) to keep your event top-of-mind to your followers. This could be anywhere from 3-4 posts a week, up to once a day.\n\n\n\nPost short-form videos (less than 60 seconds is best!) on TikTok and Instagram to take advantage of their massive Gen Z userbase to find new repeat customers. Take your followers through different parts of your event, introduce them to participating artists or staff, show time lapses of setup, and more.\n\n\n\nWhile at your event, encourage attendees to post about their experience using your event\u2019s custom hashtag (e.g., #PrimaFest). When they tag you, be sure to reshare their content on your social profiles to express your gratitude, build credibility, and nurture community.\n\n\n\nPost entertaining and helpful content that resonates with your target audience. Share details about your event, highlight your community, and give shoutouts to fans whenever you can. High-quality images, videos, and infographics perform best here, including sneak peeks, behind-the-scenes content, or teaser trailers.\n\n\n\nOffer free tickets or exclusive perks through social media contests or giveaways!\n\n\n\nDisplay your social media handles everywhere you can. The more places your handles appear, the more opportunities there are for people to follow. Add them to online posts, printed materials, emails \u2013 anywhere you can think of!\n\n\n\nInclude an interactive call-to-action in the post text (not just the caption), like, \u201cTag the biggest concert-lover you know!\u201d or \u201cGet your tickets while they last!\u201d\n\n\n\nCreate a branded event hashtag and use a few popular, relevant hashtags to expand your event\u2019s reach.\n\n\n\nInvite your Facebook friends and those interested in your event to follow you right from an action on your Facebook Page. Sometimes getting your event on the map really is that easy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeploy paid social media ads\n\n\n\nDepending on your event, audience, and budget, paid social advertising may be the perfect way to increase event awareness, gain new followers, and most importantly, sell out your event! Facebook Ads Manager provides a ton of ways to target potential customers on both Facebook and Instagram. When it comes to interest targeting, a user\u2019s \u201cinterests\u201d are based on what they share online, the ads they click, the pages they like, and much more. So, you should target your ads to interests relevant to your event. For example, if you\u2019re promoting a music festival, you might target interests like your event\u2019s performing artists, other local festivals, or music in general.\n\n\n\nTo unlock a new audience and grow your brand awareness after you\u2019ve collected enough purchase data, try exploring Lookalike Audiences. These are created from a source audience of already existing customers. Facebook then identifies common characteristics and creates a new audience for you. Basically, all the heavy lifting is done for you, and you reap the rewards!\n\n\n\nWith paid social ads, you\u2019re most likely reaching a new audience who may not have heard of your event before, so be sure your ads are friendly, informative, and engaging. Include your event details and a call to action to purchase tickets alongside the \u201cBook Now\u201d button. For your ad creative, always test between static images, short videos, and carousel ads to see what your audience interacts with the most. Remember, this is a brand new audience, so you want to select the best photos of your event to stop people in their tracks as they\u2019re scrolling.\n\n\n\nUsing social media to remarket to potential ticket buyers\n\n\n\nDid you know you can target specific website visitors who engaged with your website but have yet to purchase a ticket? With remarketing, you can zero in on those who have shown interest but haven\u2019t quite sealed the deal. These users are way more likely to place an order than those who haven\u2019t heard of your event before, so it\u2019s often more effective to re-target them again rather than start a new, broader campaign. You want to run remarketing campaigns where your audience already spends a lot of their time, like on Facebook and Instagram. If you have customer lists from previous years, remarket to them too! Uploading these lists to Facebook lets you target those specific users via social media ads. Well-timed, targeted, and interesting remarketing ads can easily be the most effective part of your social media marketing toolkit!\n\n\n\n\u200dHere are a few tips to maximize the power of your remarketing ads. Use reminder language to get your audience to buy tickets, while also adding new information about your event. Then, you could feature a testimonial from a recent attendee or influencer, or highlight a part of your event they might not already be aware of. Create a sense of urgency to get customers to buy tickets right away. (e.g., \u201cTickets are selling fast \u2013 get yours before it\u2019s too late!\u201d) Offering a discount to these audiences is another great motivator, like 20% off children\u2019s tickets or free parking. Sometimes the opportunity to save a few bucks is the only push they need!\n\n\n\n2. Email campaigns\n\n\n\n\nImportance: When sent to the right people, email marketing can be a powerful and affordable way to get the word out about your upcoming event. You can build targeted email lists from different sources including past attendees or newsletter subscribers. You already know these audiences are interested in your event, which means they\u2019re more likely to engage with your content and make a purchase!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Interest, Consideration, Action, Advocacy\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nOpen rate: The percentage of recipients who opened your email. This helps determine if your subject lines and timing are effective.\n\n\n\nClick-through rate (CTR): Measures how many people clicked on links inside your email, which can indicate how compelling your event details or offers are.\n\n\n\nConversion rate: The percentage of recipients who took the desired action (e.g., bought tickets or registered), showing the direct impact of your email campaign on ticket sales.\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe rate: Tracks how many people unsubscribed after receiving your email, helping you understand if your email content is not resonating or is being sent too frequently.\n\n\n\nRatings on post-event surveys: In your follow-up emails, these ratings from your post-event survey help you measure success in your event operations and learn areas where you can improve. It's also important to look at your overall response rate, seeing how many people are willing to complete the survey in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nInclude an attention-grabbing subject line that stands out in the inbox (emojis are highly encouraged!). For example, the subject line for a winery event might look like this: \"It\u2019s 5 O\u2019Clock Somewhere \ud83c\udf77\".\n\n\n\nUse your pre-header text to expand on your subject line, like the following: \"The Chicago Wine Festival is back and bigger than ever! Grab your tickets today!\".\n\n\n\nConduct A\/B tests on different subject lines to see which ones drive the best open rates.\n\n\n\nUse dynamic content to personalize your emails! This could include incorporating your recipients\u2019 names either in the subject line and\/or in the body of your email as well as tailoring content to their preferences. The more targeted your emails are, the better!\n\n\n\nSend out event email invitations to get those currently in your community excited about your next event!\n\n\n\nIncentivize early ticket sales by offering discounts if customers purchase tickets by a certain date, or encourage your audience to share your event with their social circles by offering group discounts (e.g., giving them 15% off when they buy four or more tickets).\n\n\n\nAdd an exciting header image from your event to get your audience hyped up about coming! Make sure to also add details about your event, like where and when it is and what to do there.\n\n\n\nMake sure your emails have one clear action for the recipient to take, such as \"Buy Tickets Now\" or \"RSVP Today\" with a link to your event listing.\n\n\n\nSend out email blasts directly from your ticketing platform (ideally for free!). Since all your ticket buyer information is already stored there, this will help keep costs down and segment your customers easier than ever before!\n\n\n\nMake sure to send a thank-you email after your event to encourage them to come back again! You could include a post-event survey or even a discount towards future events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Your event website\n\n\n\n\nImportance: On top of being the central hub for all your information (e.g., event details, ticket sales, and real-time updates), your website can bring in traffic from various channels to help turn them into excited event-goers. A well-designed website not only boosts your event\u2019s credibility and showcases your brand, but it also creates a seamless, user-friendly experience that encourages visitors to take action. As people search online for events near them, your website is a perfect page that could land on. Plus, it effortlessly integrates with other marketing efforts like social media and email campaigns, making it a powerful tool to guide potential attendees from curiosity to commitment!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness, Consideration, Action\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nTraffic volume: Measures the number of visitors to your website, indicating general interest in the event.\n\n\n\nBounce rate: Tracks the percentage of visitors who leave your website without interacting. A high bounce rate might suggest that your landing page isn\u2019t compelling enough.\n\n\n\nTime on page: The average time visitors spend on your event website, which can indicate how engaging and informative the site is.\n\n\n\nConversion rate: The percentage of website visitors who complete the desired action (e.g., sign up or purchase tickets), showing the effectiveness of your website in driving ticket sales or registrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nYour event website should be easy to navigate with clear, concise information about your events (date, location, agenda, etc.) and where to buy tickets.\n\n\n\nEnsure your website is optimized for mobile devices since this is how the majority of people will be viewing your site.\n\n\n\nShowcase past event attendees' testimonials or media coverage as social proof on your site to build credibility.\n\n\n\nMake sure it takes as few clicks as possible to navigate from your website to your ticketing page, so the path to registration or buying tickets is intuitive.\n\n\n\nOptimize your website for search engines (i.e., your SEO strategy) by including keywords related to your event type, venue, and target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Your ticketing page\n\n\n\n\nImportance: As an essential starting point to your marketing campaigns, you need an eye-catching event ticketing page to link to. Your event page should act as an extension of your brand, display key event details all in one place, and make it easy to purchase tickets in just a few clicks. A streamlined, well-optimized ticketing page minimizes buying friction, improving the user experience and boosting conversion rates. Plus, it seamlessly integrates with other marketing tools, giving you insights into sales performance and engagement to fine-tune your strategy for maximum success!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Consideration, Action\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nNumber of tickets sold: Tracks how many tickets have been sold, which is the most direct measure of event success.\n\n\n\nTickets per visitor: Tracks how many tickets each visitor buys on average, which can help you understand purchasing behavior.\n\n\n\nNumber of event check-ins: In some cases, the number of event check-ins may be more important than the number of registrations (especially if you\u2019re hosting a free event). If a lot of people are reserving tickets for your event but not showing up, you may want to adjust your marketing efforts to keep people excited and engaged between ticket purchase and event day.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nGet your tickets on sale early so you have plenty of time to reach potential buyers.\n\n\n\nBuild a ticketing page that perfectly matches your branding! This can include the images, colors, and creative messaging on your page.\n\n\n\nShare this link everywhere! Post it across your social media channels, in your emails, on your website, and more.\n\n\n\nCreate a QR code to this ticketing page (TicketLeap auto-generates one for you!) to incorporate on flyers to post around your community.\n\n\n\nMake sure your ticketing page is optimized for mobile devices. Most ticket buyers are making purchases right from their phones, so working with an online ticketing system that makes your event page look great on any device is key!\n\n\n\nOffer early bird pricing or ticket discount codes to incentivize purchases before the event.\n\n\n\nHighlight your most important event details including the date, time, location, and anything they need to know beforehand, like parking info, refund policy, dress code, and other frequently asked questions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDisplay how many tickets have been sold or how many are left to create urgency and encourage potential buyers.\n\n\n\nOffer a sensible weather guarantee for your outdoor events so attendees are more willing to purchase a ticket with peace of mind that they'll get a refund due to inclement weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of ticket discounts\n\n\n\nYou already know a great way to boost your ticket sales is by offering exclusive discounts to select audiences. Early-bird specials are key in enticing event-goers to purchase tickets early. Group tickets are great to incentivize big purchases so family and friends can attend together for less. Loyalty campaigns reward your customers and keep them coming back again and again. No matter how you offer specially priced event tickets, make sure you\u2019re tracking these efforts! Attach unique tracking parameters on your URLs when linking back to your event page for each promotion, influencer, or discount code so you know exactly where sales are coming from.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSign up with a free event ticketing platform\n\n\n\nWhile you can create a successful event marketing strategy on your own, using an event ticketing and management system sure does make it a whole lot easier! With TicketLeap\u2019s free, user-friendly system, you can get your event on sale in just five easy steps. Plus, we have built-in tools to help promote your event, integrations with Google Analytics and other services to learn more about your ticket buyers, and branded event pages that will wow your customers!\n\n\n\n5. Referral incentives\n\n\n\n\nImportance: These are a game-changer for your event marketing strategy because they tap into the unmatched power of word-of-mouth marketing. By encouraging attendees to share your event with their friends, family, and colleagues, you expand your reach in a way that is genuine and trustworthy. Personal recommendations carry immense credibility, making it easier to convert interest into ticket sales and helping you fill your event with enthusiastic attendees!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Advocacy\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nReferral conversion rate: Measures how many people who received a referral offer actually converted (e.g., purchased tickets). This shows how successful your referral program is in generating ticket sales.\n\n\n\nNumber of referrals: Tracks how many new people were referred to your event, indicating how well your referral program is being shared.\n\n\n\nReferral revenue: The total revenue generated through referrals, providing insight into the financial return of your referral incentives.\n\n\n\nReferral traffic: Measures how many website visitors came through referral links, showing how well your referral program drives traffic to your event site.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nProvide enticing rewards, such as discounted tickets, VIP access, or exclusive merchandise, to motivate people to refer their friends!\n\n\n\nUse tracking tools or unique referral codes to easily measure the success of your referral program.\n\n\n\nInclude time-sensitive offers or tiered rewards to encourage people to act fast to take advantage of your deals.\n\n\n\nProvide pre-written text or social media templates for your advocates to share, making it easier for them to refer others.\n\n\n\nActively promote your referral program on social media, email campaigns, and the event website to increase visibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with influencers\n\n\n\nWant to tap into one of the most popular event marketing trends? Scope out local personalities and social media influencers with a devoted following, and work with them to arrange a partnership! Micro-influencers could be the most effective here, with loyal fanbases ranging from 10k-100k followers. They could share video content leading up to your event with an exclusive discount code, and document how much fun they're having at your events. As authenticity becomes one of the most important marketing trends, you might even find that influencer marketing can be more affordable and powerful in reaching new audiences than other paid advertising methods!\n\n\n\n6. Public relations\n\n\n\n\nImportance: When you\u2019re looking to increase awareness of your event, don\u2019t forget about your community! There are plenty of news outlets, magazines, podcasts, blogs, or other local-specific, high-traffic websites you can place ads in or write a sponsored post for. A lot of these outlets offer banner ad placements, in-article ads, and even paid inclusion in their email newsletters, and could help get more publicity for your event, turning readers into potential event-goers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness, Interest\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nMedia coverage volume: Tracks how many media outlets have covered your event, giving insight into the reach and interest of your PR efforts.\n\n\n\nPR impressions: Measures the potential audience reached through press mentions, articles, or interviews.\n\n\n\nSentiment analysis: Analyzes the overall tone and performance of your media coverage, helping you gauge the public\u2019s perception of your event.\n\n\n\nMedia engagement: Tracks how much interaction (shares, comments, etc.) media articles are generating, reflecting how well the coverage is resonating with audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nStart pitching your event well in advance to local journalists and media outlets to secure coverage leading up to the event.\n\n\n\nConsider using an AI writing tool like ChatGPT to give you a solid starting place when writing your perfect press release!\n\n\n\nProvide a comprehensive press kit with high-quality images, event details, and media contacts to make it easy for journalists to report on your event.\n\n\n\nFocus on unique angles or noteworthy elements of your event that will attract media attention, such as headlining speakers or community impact.\n\n\n\nCollaborate with local influencers or thought leaders to amplify your event\u2019s reach and credibility.\n\n\n\nAfter your initial pitch, follow up with reporters and outlets to keep your event on their radar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Traditional marketing\n\n\n\n\nImportance: You can take your promotional efforts offline, too! Classic marketing tactics like flyers, print magazine and newspaper ads, and even billboards are an additional way to drive ticket sales. These channels are especially effective for reaching locals in your community who might not engage as much with digital platforms, ensuring your message reaches a wider demographic. Plus, when paired with digital marketing efforts, traditional methods add an extra layer of visibility and can make your event even harder to miss!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nReach: The total number of people exposed to your traditional marketing materials (flyers, posters, ads, etc.), helping you understand the overall awareness generated. While you can get exact numbers from digital channels, these numbers for your in-person advertisements are likely rough estimates based on foot traffic.\n\n\n\nEvent awareness: Use surveys or polls that track how many people are aware of your event due to traditional marketing, helping you determine if they\u2019re reaching your target audience.\n\n\n\nRedemption rate for promo codes: If you use promo codes in print ads, this measures how many people use the code, giving you insight into the effectiveness of your traditional marketing push.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nIn posters, flyers, and billboards, use bold visuals and simple messaging that stand out to passersby. The rule of thumb for billboards is that people will only read it for six seconds - so keep it short and sweet!\n\n\n\nAdvertise in places where your target audience is likely to be, such as local cafes, universities, or community centers. You could even collaborate with local businesses or organizations to cross promote through flyers, posters, and co-branded materials posted in their buildings.\n\n\n\nSend postcards or brochures to a curated list of potential attendees, especially if your event is niche or local.\n\n\n\nSecure guest spots on local radio shows or TV stations to increase event awareness in your community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Sponsorships\n\n\n\n\nImportance: Event sponsorships are a powerful addition to your event marketing strategy because they boost your event's credibility while expanding your reach to new audiences through the sponsor\u2019s network. They also bring valuable resources \u2014 whether it\u2019s funding, products, or services \u2014 that can elevate the overall event experience. Plus, sponsorships are a win-win, offering your partners increased brand visibility and deeper audience connections while helping you create an unforgettable event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing funnel level(s): Awareness, Advocacy\n\n\n\nKPIs:\n\nSponsor engagement: Measures how actively sponsors are engaging with your event through social media mentions, event presence, or other collaborative activities.\n\n\n\nSponsorship revenue: The amount of financial support or resources provided by sponsors, helping you evaluate the value of your sponsorship deals.\n\n\n\nBrand exposure for sponsors: Tracks how often your sponsors\u2019 logos or messaging are seen by event attendees or through marketing channels, helping evaluate the ROI for sponsors.\n\n\n\nSponsor satisfaction: Typically measured through surveys, it gauges how satisfied your sponsors are with their partnership and exposure, which can influence your future sponsorship deals and strengthen your relationships with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent marketing best practices:\n\nFind sponsors whose target audience aligns with your event attendees so you can create mutually beneficial partnerships that drive genuine engagement and maximum value.\n\n\n\nGive sponsors more than just logo placement \u2014 offer opportunities for them to engage directly with your audience, like hosting a workshop or Q&amp;A, putting up a sponsored photo booth, or placing a booth in an area with high foot traffic.\n\n\n\nBuild a compelling event sponsorship package, featuring different levels with varying benefits to appeal to a variety of business sizes and budgets.\n\n\n\nFeature your sponsors across all marketing channels (e.g., social media, email, website) to increase their exposure.\n\n\n\nTry partnering with local restaurants to pass out discount coupons for your event to their customers. This might be just what you need to give your ticket sales that extra boost!\n\n\n\nAfter the event, share the data and feedback you collected with sponsors to show them the return on their investment and build strong future partnerships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster the art of marketing for events\n\n\n\nEvent marketing is key to your event's success! With the right strategy and tools, you can fill your event with excited attendees and make it the talk of the town. By leveraging the channels and best practices outlined in this guide \u2014 social media, email campaigns, referral incentives, traditional marketing, and more \u2014 you can build a well-rounded plan that gets your event in front of the right people at the right time.

We've created a list of unique Halloween party themes for adults that are sure to give your attendees goosebumps! Once you've picked your favorite idea, we strongly encourage you to make it your own and cater it to your event's audience (like toning it down to be more family-friendly, if needed).\n\n\n\n1. Classic horror movie&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor this theme, take inspiration from classic horror films like&nbsp;Nightmare on Elm Street,&nbsp;Halloween, or&nbsp;Frankenstein. Whether your event is centered around one film or you mix in multiple, encourage your attendees to dress up as their favorite characters. As some extra motivation, consider hosting a contest for the most creative costume. Offer prizes like&nbsp;discounted tickets&nbsp;to future events, free merch, etc. You could also test your attendees' Halloween film knowledge with a round of trivia on your chosen movie theme, stirring up a little friendly competition to really top the night off!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Vampires\n\n\n\nGet creative with the blood-sucking details of this theme to really bring your event to life. Think of all the lore associated with vampires, like strings of garlic or the need to avoid sunlight, and incorporate them into your&nbsp;Halloween decorations. As one idea, setting up a serving station of cherry, strawberry, or any red-colored beverage labeled with different blood types can add a hilarious touch that'll have attendees pretending like they're vampires. As another, having your venue dimly lit with the windows boarded up can be a fun play on the idea that vampires burn in the sun.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Mad scientist\n\n\n\nFallen test tubes, microscopes with obscure substances, beakers filled with luminous liquids \u2013 the possibilities of this theme are endless! Set up your scene of chaos with these lab-related decorations, plus some dimmed or flickering lights. At the entrance, use caution tape to section off your check-in lines as you scan people in with your&nbsp;ticket scanning app. When serving food, consider writing your menus out on notebook-styled sheets with the frantic scribblings of a scientist around the edges. Plus, for a more immersive experience in your mad scientist's lab, hook up a fog machine, hand out lab coats to each of your attendees, and turn on some black lights to really make all your chemical concoctions pop.\n\n\n\n4. Carnival\n\n\n\nThere's something naturally unsettling about clowns that can make a carnival one of the perfect scary Halloween themes. From the tiniest woman in the world to double-headed snakes, decorate your venue with the wonders of the world that one may witness at a creepy hometown carnival. On top of the more traditional carnival acts, create some spooky wonders of your own. Invite real paranormal talent like mediums, psychics, or other people with unique abilities like contortionists. And don't forget those classic carnival games! Include games that'll really pull this theme together like balloon darts, whack-a-mole, and fish bowl toss to win some awesome prizes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Edgar Allen Poe&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEdgar Allen Poe is widely known for his tales of terror, so if you're a literature fanatic, this theme is the one for you! Teleport your attendees to the 1800's by decorating your space to match the era. Be sure to include dark birds and aged book paper to reflect Edgar Allen Poe's writing! Encourage your attendees to dress according to the time period to further transport them into the Victorian era. Fine-tune your event's details with references to some of his popular pieces, like decorating with ravens from \u201cThe Raven\u201d or serving wine from Amontillado to reflect his short story \u201cThe Cask of Amontillado.\u201d To keep your attendees engaged throughout the event, host short activities throughout like trivia, crossword puzzles, or scavenger hunts related to your Halloween theme.\n\n\n\n6. Slaughterhouse\n\n\n\nThis is one of those adult Halloween party themes that's just so frightening, people will want to go with a large group of friends \u2013 which means&nbsp;more ticket sales! Blood, bones, and butcher knives with plastic tarps draped along the walls can make for the perfect entrance to your haunted slaughterhouse. Consider adding signs inside your event of different butcher cuts or directions for butchering an animal.&nbsp;Halloween event safety&nbsp;always comes first, so ensure all seemingly dangerous items are just harmless props and are secured in place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n7. Zombie apocalypse&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe world may be ending, but the party has just begun! Let your guests choose whether they want to come in their best zombie defense gear or in their scariest flesh-eating zombie costume. Offer up appetizing zombie cuisine like jello eyeballs or brain cake. To make your event space look like the apocalypse has begun, use pieces of a manikin dressed in tattered clothing with bite marks to scatter around your venue. Then, dance the night away to Halloween-themed music like \u201cThriller\u201d by Michael Jackson and even recreate the iconic dance moves from his music video!\n\n\n\n8. Exorcist&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPut the \u201ctrick\u201d in trick or treat with this spine-chilling Halloween theme! Incorporate simple illusions like creepy eye-following pictures or gravity-defying objects to make your event seem possessed or allude to a supernatural presence being around. You can even set up a seance table with candles and Ouija boards to add a bit of eerie flare. Consider posting videos of your freaky setup to&nbsp;TikTok&nbsp;and other social media platforms to get your attendees morbidly curious about your event!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs you begin your Halloween event planning, be sure to incorporate your theme into your&nbsp;haunt marketing strategy&nbsp;and on your event's ticketing page too.

From your attendance rate to social media metrics, event analytics paint a vibrant picture of your attendees' engagement. Armed with this knowledge, you can fine-tune your strategies, improve your event operations, and craft experiences that better resonate with your attendees. So, hang tight as we break down how to evaluate an event in bite-sized pieces, making it a breeze to grasp.\n\n\n\nKey metrics for event success\n\n\n\nEvent success metrics are like measurable building blocks that give you a clear look at different parts of your event. They let you see how well things are going in ways that everyone can understand. Now, what metrics you decide to track will help you select your event goals and measure your performance. The specific goals you try to reach with these metrics are called your key performance indicators (or KPIs). For instance, as you're keeping an eye on your attendance metrics, your KPI might be boosting attendance by a specific margin. Therefore, think of your metrics and KPIs as the dynamic duo guiding your event evaluation journey toward success.\n\n\n\nThe primary categories of key metrics\n\n\n\nIf you find yourself wondering how to measure event engagement, you've come to the right place! Here are some of the main buckets of different metrics you might gather that'll help you in your event planning:\n\n\n\n1. Attendance metrics\n\n\n\n\nNew vs. returning attendees:&nbsp;Assess how many of your total attendees are first-timers versus who's visited your events before, helping you more fully understand your event's overall turnout.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTicket sales: Track the number of&nbsp;online ticket sales, paying attention to things like the time periods when your sales increased the most, which dates of a multi-day event sold more tickets, and how much you sold of each ticket type (like general admission, VIP, bundles, etc.).\n\n\n\nAttendance rate: Determine how successful you were in converting your signups to actual attendees by calculating the number of attendees from the number of total registrations.\n\n\n\n\n2. Engagement metrics\n\n\n\n\nSocial media engagement: Analyze likes, shares, and comments on your event-related posts on social media platforms like&nbsp;Facebook,&nbsp;Instagram, or&nbsp;TikTok.\n\n\n\nPost-event surveys: Tally the number of completed surveys from your attendees that you'll later analyze to identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\nEmail campaign metrics: Assess the open and click-through rates of your marketing emails to determine which campaigns were the most successful at driving additional ticket sales.\n\n\n\nWebsite traffic: View metrics like the click-through rate, page views, and average time on site to understand how a user interacts with your event website.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n3. Conversion metrics\n\n\n\n\nLeads generated: Track the number of new leads acquired during the event (this'll be especially important for your event's sponsors!).\n\n\n\nRevenue by promo code: Assess which promo codes from your&nbsp;event pricing strategy&nbsp;generated the most revenue and get a glimpse of which marketing campaigns were most successful.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpsells:&nbsp;Measure the amount generated from additional revenue streams on event day and through your ticketing site, including merchandise, reserved parking, food, drinks, tickets to future events, and more.\n\n\n\nReturn on investment (ROI): Calculate your event's ROI by comparing the revenue earned from your event against the costs involved in organizing it.\n\n\n\n\n4 tools for gathering event data\n\n\n\nLet's dive into the behind-the-scenes magic! To get a true measure of your event's success, it's essential to collect vital data related to your chosen KPIs. From event management software to website analytics, the following data collection tools help simplify event tracking, provide deeper insights, and allow effortless data sharing. It's a practical way to ensure you're well-informed about your event's performance and armed with meaningful insights.\n\n\n\n1.

Social media analytics tools\n\n\n\nSocial media analytics unwrap the mystery behind your online presence, revealing who's talking about your event, what's getting shared, and which posts are turning heads. To gauge your audience's enthusiasm for your content, you can check out your engagement metrics (such as likes, shares, and comments) directly on each social media platform. Keep a close watch on your content's reach to see just how far your event's message is traveling across social platforms.\n\n\n\nYou can also recruit third-party tools like&nbsp;Hootsuite&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sprout Social&nbsp;to help you deep dive into your insights at a glance. Social media analytics take you from just uploading a post to strategically crafting content that better resonates with your followers, making your event's online presence louder than ever.\n\n\n\n3. Web analytics platforms\n\n\n\nA web analytics platform reveals the behavioral patterns of your website visitors, shedding light on how they discovered your site, what content resonates, and how they navigate your event's landing page.&nbsp;As an option, Google Analytics 4&nbsp;is a tool that empowers you to delve into your website traffic, user demographics, and most popular pages, giving you valuable insights into your attendees' interests.\n\n\n\nTo make this even easier, tools like&nbsp;Hotjar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Crazy Egg&nbsp;offer visual heatmaps and user session recordings, providing a front-row seat to visitor interactions and pain points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4.

Whether it's for pitching to prospective&nbsp;event sponsors&nbsp;or keeping your hardworking&nbsp;event staff&nbsp;in the loop, data presented right can be a game-changer! Charts, graphs, and tables can be your trusty tools for showcasing trends and insights. Add comparisons and benchmarks to give your data context, as well as use color coding and clear labels.&nbsp;LookerStudio&nbsp;can help you easily make your visualizations appealing to the eye and easy to understand.\n\n\n\nLeveraging event analytics to make informed decisions\n\n\n\nYou've got the ultimate toolkit at your fingertips for growing your events \u2013 analytics! This information can be a clear indicator of what your next step should be to amp up your event. Think about attendance metrics. If you notice fewer people showing up than expected, it's a nudge to rethink your&nbsp;event marketing&nbsp;game or maybe shuffle your event's timing. Your conversion metrics can provide insight into what strategies turn leads into sales, letting you know which efforts to push. For engagement, if there's high app usage, you may want to direct more resources to enhance the app experience.\n\n\n\nThe trick lies in using this data as a compass.

If you're ready to face your biggest fears and experience new horrors untold, New York has some seriously scary attractions you need to check out this Halloween. From haunted hayrides, to terror trails, to eerie asylums, here are eight of the most frightening experiences in the Empire State.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling Hills Asylum\n\n\n\nEast Bethany, NY\n\n\n\nRolling Hills Asylum&nbsp;is the perfect place for those brave enough to explore the paranormal. Rated as one of the most haunted places in the U.S., Rolling Hills Asylum is known for its real-life hauntings. Take a guided tour of the asylum and listen to the stories of others who have walked before you. Or set out on your own paranormal adventure during a private ghost hunt. Take a deep breath, grab your flashlight, and prepare to experience true paranormal activity \u2013 if you dare.\u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleepy Hollow Haunted Hayride\n\n\n\nSleepy Hollow, NY\n\n\n\nTest your courage (and sanity) at the&nbsp;Village of Sleepy Hollow's Haunted Hayride. For over 10 years, people have traveled from all over to climb aboard one of their hayrides for a spine-chilling adventure through the dark woods, full of the ghastly creatures and wayworn monsters that usually hide under your bed. In fact, you'll follow the exact path Ichabod Crane took while fleeing the headless Horseman in Sleepy Hollow. Too afraid to ride? Fear not! There's also a block party with live music, vendors, and family-friendly activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSyracuse Walk of the Dead\n\n\n\nLiverpool, NY\n\n\n\nTake a walk on some of the most terrifying trails New York has to offer at the&nbsp;Syracuse Walk of the Dead.

Work up the nerve to make your way through the dark corridors of the Haunted Hallways and face off against the scares that are waiting around every corner. As you travel through the Sinister Estate, you'll find yourself awaiting the doctor's order for brutal mistreatment in the Asylum. Will you make it out alive or become the very thing you fear the most?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Matter Scream Works\n\n\n\nRochester, NY\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for a truly memorable fright, check out&nbsp;Dark Matter Scream Works, an indoor attraction with five different haunted houses.

With three of the original stone buildings still standing today, this property dates back to the early 1800s.

If you have a passion for puzzles, a taste for suspense, and a knack for hosting unforgettable events, then organizing a murder mystery is the perfect choice for you. In these six steps, learn how to host a murder mystery dinner party that'll have your guests on the edge of their seats!\n\n\n\nWhat is a murder mystery dinner?\n\n\n\nA murder mystery dinner party is a themed dinner revolving around a role-playing mystery game, where those in attendance try to figure out who's secretly the murderer. It's a perfect mystery game for adults who want to immerse themselves in a suspenseful storyline and work together to solve a spooky whodunit. This type of event is particularly popular around Halloween, although this could easily be hosted any time of year.\n\n\n\nNow, let's cut to the chase and uncover the secrets of&nbsp;how to plan&nbsp;a murder mystery party.\n\n\n\n1. Plan your story\n\n\n\nThe story of your murder mystery is the lifeblood of your spooky event. To get you started, you can pick your plot line in one of these two ways:\n\n\n\nPurchase a murder mystery kit\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for a foolproof way to host a murder mystery dinner party (especially if it's your first time), then purchasing a&nbsp;murder mystery kit&nbsp;is a great place to start! These kits are carefully designed to create an engaging experience right out of the box. Inside, you'll find character profiles, intriguing clues, scripts, and step-by-step instructions to help you effortlessly navigate the entire event. Choose from a wide variety of themes with plenty of unique roles for everyone interested in playing.\n\n\n\nCreate your own murder mystery&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWant to add a unique flair to your murder mystery? Crafting your own story grants you extra creative freedom, particularly when choosing your event's theme and characters. This is an especially perfect option if you're a theater or musical organization planning to use your own actors.\n\n\n\nTo get started, brainstorm a compelling plot with twists and turns that'll keep everyone guessing. Create detailed character profiles, including backgrounds, motives, and secrets, to help your mystery's participants (whether that's your attendees or a designated cast) bring their characters to life. Develop clues and evidence that lead to the big reveal, and ensure your talented actors are well-rehearsed with scripts or prompts to guide their interactions during the dinner party. If you're looking for some extra inspiration, check out scripts online to help you get started with fresh ideas!&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Set the stage\n\n\n\nBased on your theme, decorate the space with props like crime scene tape, vintage photographs, or mysterious artifacts. Enhance the ambiance with dimmed lighting or candlelit tables to create an atmosphere of suspense. Consider playing themed background music, burning a specific aroma throughout the night, or keeping the room at a brisk temperature for a bone-chilling experience. You can even select a venue that aligns with the theme of your murder mystery (like an old historic building or a cozy cabin) for an extra layer of magic to your event. To add to the immersive atmosphere, encourage your guests to dress up according to the theme too. If you're using your own actors for the show, they could even pretend to be a part of the audience and later reveal themselves for a wild surprise once the story starts!\n\n\n\n3. Spread the word\n\n\n\nCaptivate your guests from the start with an eye-catching&nbsp;event page&nbsp;and a proper invitation. Use a ticketing platform like TicketLeap to effortlessly create custom event pages that match the theme of your murder mystery and get people excited to buy their tickets. Then, send out alluring&nbsp;email invitations&nbsp;to your prospective guests, complete with your full event details and spooky graphics. TicketLeap is full of additional&nbsp;haunt ticketing features&nbsp;that'll make it easy for you to also send any necessary waivers or registration forms to your ticket buyers before they get to the crime scene.\n\n\n\n4. Serve a themed dinner\n\n\n\nAligning the menu of your event with the theme of your event is key to mastering how to plan a murder mystery dinner. Incorporate dishes that reflect the time period or setting of your murder mystery. For example, if you're hosting a 1920's theme, impress your guests with classic cocktails like martinis or old fashioneds. To add an extra layer of intrigue, label the dishes with creative names tied to the storyline like \"Poisoned Pear Salad\" or \"Fatal Fettuccine Alfredo.\" Consider asking about potential dietary restrictions in your event's&nbsp;registration questions&nbsp;as well. That way, you can accommodate those guests and ensure everyone gets to enjoy your delicious meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Assign your characters\n\n\n\nIf you're planning to have attendees participate in the mystery itself, you can use the information you gathered from your registration form to assign the perfect character to each of them. Once you've done this, it's important to send out character assignments as soon as possible (ideally 2-4 weeks in advance). This gives them ample time to read up on their characters and understand their backgrounds, motives, and secrets. They may even find a costume that matches their character's personality. If you're using your own actors, you should still share character information with your attendees beforehand. This helps them get familiar with the story and start thinking about who the true suspect might be.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Solve the mystery!\n\n\n\nAs the night unfolds and tension builds, it's time to put your detective skills to the test and solve the murder mystery at your dinner party. Encourage your guests to interact, question suspects, and gather clues to piece together the puzzle. Try incorporating a voting system where guests can cast their votes on who they believe is the culprit. Finally, at the grand reveal, announce the true identity of the murderer and congratulate those who solved the mystery. Award prizes for the most astute detective or the best-dressed character to add an extra element of friendly competition. Don't forget to take&nbsp;event photos&nbsp;and videos throughout the night to capture the excitement! Afterwards, you can share these highlights to your social media and use them when&nbsp;marketing your future spooky events.\n\n\n\nYour murder mystery awaits \u2014 let TicketLeap\u00a0be your partner in crime!

Read on to learn everything you need to know about chargebacks, TicketLeap's efforts to win them for you, and some strategies to mitigate them from the get-go.\n\n\n\nWhat are chargebacks?\n\n\n\nA chargeback occurs when a buyer disputes a charge to their account directly with their credit card company. In regards to your event, ticket buyers would typically claim that they didn't authorize the purchase, or that they didn't receive the experience they were promised. While some chargebacks are filed shortly following a transaction, they can be filed up to four months after a purchase! The most common types of chargeback disputes in the events industry include:\n\n\n\n1. Fraudulent purchases\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims someone stole their credit card and used it to buy tickets. Bigger attractions like haunted houses, festivals, and concerts tend to face more of this activity.\n\n\n\n2. Services not rendered\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims they bought tickets but never redeemed them or attended your event.\n\n\n\n3. Duplicate processing\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims they were charged twice for the same order of tickets or merchandise.\n\n\n\n4. Credit not processed\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims they canceled or returned their purchased tickets but have not yet received a refund.\n\n\n\n5. Not as described or defective\n\n\n\nThe cardholder claims the goods\/services they received didn't match your event's description.\n\n\n\nHow TicketLeap addresses every chargeback claim\n\n\n\nUnlike other ticketing companies, TicketLeap has a full-time risk manager whose main responsibility is to manage the chargeback process, address every single chargeback,&nbsp;and provide as much evidence as possible for the best chance at winning each case. Because of these efforts, we have successfully won over 50% of chargeback claims filed \u2013 nearly 20% above the&nbsp;industry average&nbsp;win rate of 32%! So rest assured, your events are in good hands with us.\n\n\n\nFrom initial claim to seeing the money back in your account, disputing a chargeback can take between 45 to 90 days. After the cardholder initially contacts their bank, we (your ticketing provider) receive a notice that the dispute has been filed and have 30 days to respond. We first determine if the filer has a legitimate claim. For example, they may have had their card stolen and deserve a refund. If the claim doesn't seem legitimate, however, our team notifies the event organizer about each chargeback and provides the buyer's name, the dispute reason, and their order information. Organizers are then encouraged to reach out to buyers directly if they feel the chargeback has been filed in error.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf the event organizer and customer aren't able to come to an agreement, we'll move forward with disputing the chargeback by putting a case together to fight it. During this process, we must confirm the filer actually bought tickets and attended the event, and send proof that demonstrates the dispute doesn't have a strong enough case to merit a chargeback. This can be anything from scan logs with timestamps, to&nbsp;event photos&nbsp;customers may have posted on social media. Once the evidence is submitted to the bank, the case will remain open for approximately 45 days before a ruling happens. If the case is won, TicketLeap (and you!) retains the revenue. If the case is lost, the funds are withdrawn from TicketLeap and given back to the cardholder.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow event organizers can prevent chargebacks\n\n\n\nWhile TicketLeap works around the clock to help you prevent chargebacks, there's also a few actions you can take to stop them in their tracks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Have buyers sign your refund policy\n\n\n\nAsking your ticket buyers to sign an event waiver and refund policy ensures they understand how you handle refunds and what to expect from your event. This policy gives you clear evidence to challenge any chargebacks in the future.\n\n\n\n2. Scan tickets at the gate\n\n\n\nRedeeming tickets at the door provides you with key evidence to help fight fraud, as it shows who entered your event and who didn't. Later, you can pull up any attendee from your scan logs if they claim they never attended.\n\n\n\n3. Require ID and credit card verification\n\n\n\nVerify your ticket buyers' identities by requiring them to show the credit card they used to purchase as well as their IDs to ensure that those entering your venue are who they say they are.\n\n\n\n4. Have onsite staff monitor for suspicious activity\n\n\n\nAssign a couple staff members to patrol the admissions line, using multiple iPads to check in and verify attendees up and down the line so that all they have to do at the gate is scan their tickets. In doing so, it will help keep the wait times down and allows your staff to be on the lookout for scalpers trying to resell tickets to others in line.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. Turn off ticket sales prior to your event's start time\n\n\n\nBecause fraudsters will try to buy tickets as close to your event as possible, be sure to close online ticket sales prior to your event's start time and only sell tickets at the box office on event day. A good rule of thumb is to turn off online ticket sales 24 hours before the start of your event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Review large ticket orders\n\n\n\nLarge orders (typically eight or more tickets) are more likely to involve fraudulent activity like scalping because the buyer can resell those tickets in bulk to make a quick profit. When monitoring orders, look out for fake email addresses, unusual names, billing addresses that don't match (especially locations far away from your event), and duplicate emails or names on multiple orders.\n\n\n\n7. Reach out to buyers with suspected fraudulent orders\n\n\n\nIf you do suspect fraudulent activity, contact the ticket buyer directly and say you'll refund the order unless you hear otherwise in the next 48 hours. If it was a genuine mistake, they'll let you know.\n\n\n\nChargebacks aren't fun for anyone, so it's important to have a trusted team fighting them for you. With TicketLeap on your side, you'll have the peace of mind to focus on planning and selling tickets to your next big event. With a dedicated team ready to challenge every chargeback, no other ticketing company fights for you as hard as TicketLeap does!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/62d011c7978ce8d8d48cec70_tl-chargeback-optimized-scaled-1-1024x287.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":95,"name":"Event Operations","slug":"event-operations","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":95,"taxonomy":"category","description":"From booking the venue to hiring staff, there are tons of moving parts to putting your event together!

You've come to the right place! In between attending classes and studying for exams, college students are always looking for new, fun experiences to enjoy with their friends. To help you create your next college event, our experts have put together a list of must-attend events that are sure to be the talk around campus and give students plenty of memories for long after graduation.\n\n\n\nTypes of college events perfect year-round\n\n\n\n1. \"Stuff-a-Plush\" events\n\n\n\nNot only does \u201cStuff-a-Plush\u201d offer a unique activity for your student body to do with their friends, it also gives them a cute keepsake to bring back to their dorm. At this event, give out unstuffed plushies for students to fill with stuffing and seal up themselves for an added personal touch. Pick a theme, like animals or food, and offer different plushies based around that. You can even encourage them to register ahead of time to guarantee they'll get the plushie they want. Host events like this throughout the year, especially around the holidays, so that students can bring one home as a gift to a family member or loved one!\n\n\n\n2. On-campus concerts\n\n\n\nGive students the chance to jam out to their favorite bands and artists within walking distance from their dorms! Host a range of performances from local talent to celebrity artists (depending on your budget) as either special one-time events or as part of a semester-long concert series. When students register on your concert's event page, be sure to include a survey to discover who they hope comes to campus next, so you can book performers you know will bring in excited fans!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Film festival\n\n\n\nLights, camera, action! There's nothing like a film festival to bring together students who share a passion for cinema. From documentaries to animations, it's all about celebrating indie films created by your current students, or even by alumni. Premiere these movies in a theater on campus, like in your student center, and even have a red carpet into the entrance for students as they arrive. As one of your cultural event ideas to enlighten your student body and nurture further conversations, you could even set up a Q&amp;A panel after the films for people to ask the creators themselves about the stories behind their masterpieces. So why not grab some popcorn and settle in for a night of cinematic adventures with your fellow movie buffs? Who knows, you might even be watching the next big blockbuster before anyone else!\n\n\n\n4. Comedy nights\n\n\n\nLooking for the perfect college event to break the ice and get your students laughing together? Host a comedy night! It's a great way to lighten the mood and encourage students to come together for some good old belly laughs. From stand-up acts to improv showdowns, there\u2019s no end to the fun. Plus, it\u2019s a brilliant opportunity for budding comedians on campus to strut their stuff. Invite your students to the stage, crack some jokes, and watch as the room fills with laughter \u2013 making it a night to remember!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Video game tournaments\n\n\n\nLevel up your university life with something totally epic: a video game tournament! In the growing world of esports, this is the perfect opportunity to bring together students who love gaming and friendly competition. Set up different consoles or PCs with popular games like Valorant, Overwatch, or Super Smash Bros and let the battles begin! Bring together teams from different student organizations, majors, or even across other college campuses to compete for various prizes like a brand new gaming console or a cash prize.\n\n\n\n6. Silent disco\n\n\n\nImagine this: a dance floor bustling with energy, yet not a single beat heard out loud. Welcome to the world of silent disco! For this super fun event, each guest gets their own set of headphones, tuning into music that's DJ-ed live. Get lost in the music and dance like nobody's watching (because they're all in their own musical world). It's a surefire way to create a buzz on campus, bring people together, and make some noise (quietly, of course).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Karaoke night\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love singing along to their favorite songs? Putting on a karaoke night is a fan-favorite college event that allows everyone to let loose and have some fun. Simply rent a karaoke machine or even just set up a microphone, speakers, and a screen to play the lyrics on (and maybe even a projector to get more students engaged and singing along). If you want to go a step further, you could throw a friendly competition for the best performance or encourage students to dress up as their favorite artists (Elvis anyone?).\n\n\n\nThis event is sure to bring out the star in everyone and uncover some hidden talents (or at least, enthusiastic attempts). And be sure to capture the best performances for your college's social media! Whether you're a shower singer or the next big thing, it's all about enriching your university life with college event ideas like this to have a blast with friends.\n\n\n\n8. Scavenger hunt\n\n\n\nReady for an adventure that'll take your students on a wild ride across campus, uncovering clues and solving puzzles with friends? Put together a scavenger hunt and turn your campus into a treasure map! Not only will it get students active and moving, but scavenger hunts also encourage teamwork and critical thinking skills. Create clues that lead to various locations around campus until the final treasure is found. This is a great idea for building school spirit as students learn more about historic places on your campus they might not have otherwise known about. Add some hidden goodies through your scavenger hunt for an extra incentive and watch as students race to be the first ones to finish!\n\n\n\n9. Dorm decor crafts\n\n\n\nCraft workshops are a perfect opportunity for new students to make new friends while creating fun decorations for their dorm! Who doesn't want to personalize their room to match their unique personality and aesthetic? For example, they could build their own potted plants or mini terrariums with fake or real plants. They can make string art for their wall with just wooden boards, some nails, a hammer, and colored string. Or they can let their imaginations run wild as they hand paint wooden pencil holders for their desk, express themselves on a blank canvas, or put together a vision board of their personal goals. The possibilities are endless!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Trivia nights\n\n\n\nEver thought about jazzing up those regular college nights with something super fun? Try hosting a trivia night as one of your university events! At these types of cultural events, test your students' knowledge on anything from popular movies to everything Taylor Swift to the latest in college sports. You could host a monthly trivia night with a different themed topic each time and prizes tied to that theme as well. So, bring your students together, pick a popular theme, and let the trivia battles begin!\n\n\n\n11. Open mics\n\n\n\nShine a spotlight on all the raw talent in your student body with an open mic night! It's the perfect platform to invite students to share their talents. To help ensure your open mic runs smoothly, you can have students use your powerful ticketing platform to register beforehand for their desired time slot. Otherwise, they can wait to sign up for their time slot when they get there. Whether it's soulful poetry, side-splitting comedy, or acoustic jams, an open mic night is bound to bring your community together as they perform for their fellow students.\n\n\n\n12. Ping-pong ball drop\n\n\n\nIt's simple: pick the tallest building on your campus and drop buckets of ping pong balls from it. Pretty straightforward, right? But wait, there's more! There are two ways to spice up this game. First, set up a target on the ground close to where you'll be dropping the balls from. Then have students write their names on a select number of ping pong balls for the chance to win cash prizes, gift cards, or other bonuses if they're one of the closest to that target.\n\n\n\nAs a second idea, put specially marked ping pong balls into the mix beforehand. As you drop all the balls from the building, students can stand under the shower of ping pong balls (with or without an umbrella) and collect the specially marked ones to win a prize! Whether you're on&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;TikTok, or&nbsp;Facebook, this experience will make for some great content for your school's social media pages too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Sports tournaments\n\n\n\nOrganizing an intramural sports tournament at your school is another great way to engage students and build school spirit! This could be a one-day event or spread out over the course of a week, depending on the number of teams and types of sports involved. You can choose to focus on traditional team sports such as basketball, soccer, or volleyball, or mix it up with some more unique options like ultimate frisbee, kickball, or even an obstacle course race. If you're looking to expand beyond traditional sports, consider hosting a field day or mini Olympics with various activities like tug of war, relay races, and even a water balloon toss.\n\n\n\nUsing your ticketing platform for people to sign up, students from each campus organization could register their teams to play against each other. You could have specific tournaments for graduate students or a friendly rivalry between senior students and other classes. To make sure everyone feels included, you can also have different divisions for different skill levels or allow students to sign up individually and form new teams with their peers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of outdoor event ideas for college students\n\n\n\n14. Outdoor festivals\n\n\n\nKick off or wrap up the semester with a campus-wide outdoor festival. Get students excited by promoting unique headlining activities, like a bull ride simulator, an&nbsp;inflatable obstacle course, a zipline, or anything else they don't get to experience every day! Plus, if you offer free food and good music, students will find themselves drawn to the festivities and inviting their friends, too. Have students&nbsp;register online&nbsp;beforehand with their student ID and shirt size for a (free) exclusive festival t-shirt to drive even more traffic to your event and give you a better idea of how many students will be attending. With unique activities and free fun galore, your festival is bound to be the buzz around campus!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Outdoor movie nights\n\n\n\nNothing says summer like watching a movie under the stars! Set up a projector and screen in an open area on campus and invite students to bring blankets, pillows, and snacks for a cozy night of entertainment. You can choose popular blockbusters or have themed nights based on student votes. Is there rain in the forecast? Rather than canceling your event, you could always watch the movie in your student center. It\u2019s the perfect way to kick back, relax, and enjoy some quality time outside the lecture halls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16. One-day hiking adventure\n\n\n\nHelp switch up your college students' same old routine of going to class, studying, and hanging out on campus with one-off hiking adventures! Partner with your university's recreation center to host organized hikes, mini kayaking trips, rock climbing, and other outdoor activities as a national park, hiking trail, or nature reserve near campus. It's the perfect opportunity for team building, making new friends, and getting to explore areas that students may have never been before \u2013 from serene lakes to towering forests.\n\n\n\n17. Bonfires\n\n\n\nGather around a crackling fire with some marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers for one of the best summer social event ideas for university students! Bonfires are the perfect way to bring students together and get to know each other better. You can even add in some extra fun activities like ghost stories or group games to keep the night going. Make sure to check with your university about any fire codes or regulations before planning this event. Verify that your campus allows bonfires and ensure a staff member supervises it constantly. Additionally, it's important to check your state and city's open burn regulations, along with any local laws about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Barn parties\n\n\n\nTime to bust out the cowboy hats and overalls! Hosted in an actual barn or transformed space on campus, these parties can include hayrides, live music, and good ol' square dancing. They offer a rustic and laid-back atmosphere for people to socialize (especially new students!) and have barrels of fun. Consider adding some themed decorations and other activities like putting up a mini petting zoo, bobbing for apples, or even renting out a mechanical bull for this rowdy campus event. Don't forget to provide plenty of food and drinks, including some classic farm-inspired dishes like BBQ, corn on the cob, and apple cider.\n\n\n\n19. Hot air balloon rides\n\n\n\nUp, up, and away! Take in the breathtaking views of your campus and surrounding areas while floating high above the ground in a hot air balloon ride. Whether it's a solo adventure or one with a group of friends, college students will love the chance to make unforgettable memories and check off an item from their bucket list. Plus, it's a unique way to see the campus from a different perspective and appreciate its beauty. As one of the more involved college events, you could get local businesses to sponsor the ride, including letting them set up a tent near where students line up for the balloon ride, giving them ample shoutouts, or include their information in a swag bag for students. You could even turn the event into a full-blown festival with food trucks, inflatables, free t-shirts, and more! This college campus event is sure to be the talk of the semester!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoliday events for college students\n\n\n\n20. Fall festival\n\n\n\nLooking for some college event ideas to host this fall? Try hosting a fall festival for your college students! Decorate the quad or main gathering area with hay bales, pumpkins, and autumn decorations to set the scene. You could have food trucks and local vendors selling seasonal treats like apple cider and pumpkin spice lattes. Plus, you should plan fun activities like bobbing for apples, pumpkin carving contests, and corn hole tournaments. This is a great way to help get incoming students involved and celebrate the changing seasons!\n\n\n\n21. Pumpkin carving\n\n\n\nNothing says Halloween more than some spooky jack o' lanterns! As one of your fun events on campus for Halloween, set up some pumpkins for students to carve or paint to their hearts' content. Not only is it a creative way to get into the Halloween spirit, but it also allows students to express themselves and gives them a chance to get together with friends. You can even make it into a contest and have students vote on their favorite pumpkin for a prize!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22. Murder mystery dinner\n\n\n\nLooking for some unique social event ideas to kick off the Halloween season? Try hosting a murder mystery dinner! This fun and interactive event will have students solving a spooky crime while enjoying a delicious (free!) meal together. You can either hire a professional company to run the event or create your own murder mystery storyline with the help of your student body (like college students in your theater department). You can use your ticketing platform to send an invitation email with all the details, including encouraging attendees to dress up in their best detective or suspect attire for an even more immersive experience.\n\n\n\n23. Ice skating\n\n\n\nWhether you're a beginner or an experienced skater, hitting the ice rink with friends is always a fun event around Christmas! Rent a synthetic ice rink for students to skate in and set it up on a large, flat area of your campus grounds. Then, students could arrive bundled up and ready to skate, either by renting skates from the rink or bringing their own. You can even make it more interesting for your students by hosting themed nights, like \"Ugly Sweater Skating\" or \"Skating in Pajamas.\" After that, you can provide a hot cocoa bar and snacks to warm back up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24. Gingerbread house competition\n\n\n\nWant to spice up the festive season with a little competitive spirit? A gingerbread house competition is a perfect excuse for your college students to let their creativity flow as they gear up for the holidays. Picture heaps of icing, mountains of gumdrops, and stacks of gingerbread, all coming together in a cozy, laughter-filled room. You could provide small gingerbread house kits for students, or let them build their own creations from scratch. Graham crackers are also a cost effective option! Once they're done, let people vote for their favorites! It\u2019s a sweet way to de-stress during exam season!\n\n\n\n25. Galentines' day\n\n\n\nWho says Valentine's Day is only for couples? Celebrate friendship and love by hosting a Galentine's day as one of your Valentine's Day ideas for college students. Have attendees bring their favorite dish to share, whether it's heart-shaped pancakes or heart-shaped fruit skewers. You could set up a chocolate bar too complete with a chocolate fountain to dip strawberries, marshmallows, and other delicious treats into. Play a rom com in the background to snuggle up with some cozy blankets to watch (wearing pajamas is encouraged!). Make sure to have pink heart decorations and set up some games to add to the fun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health events for finals week\n\n\n\n26. Donut stress\n\n\n\nAs a sweet way to curb that nagging test anxiety, put together a \u201cDonut Stress\u201d event with free donuts. Get students excited amidst the stress of exams by also offering additional types of sweet treats, coffee, mini massages, and more. College can be stressful, so why not take a break and pamper yourself? This is definitely among some of the most popular college social events ideas for finals week and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27. Mediation workshops\n\n\n\nHosting events throughout exam week to help students refresh and recharge can be the perfect boost they need to finish that paper or ace that test. Give students strategies to better decompress and promote more balance in campus life. You could organize this as an in person event or make it an online session for students to register for. This can be a great way to introduce students to the benefits of self-care and mindfulness, while also providing them with valuable tools for managing stress during finals week.\n\n\n\n28. Yoga sessions\n\n\n\nSimilar to mediation workshops, hosting yoga sessions can also be a super effective way to help students relieve stress and anxiety during finals week. You could partner with a local yoga studio or have a certified instructor lead the session on campus. Invite students to bring their own mats and promote people to attend events like this as an opportunity for them to take a break from studying and focus on their physical and mental well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29. Late-night breakfast bar\n\n\n\nWho doesn't love breakfast food? Organizing a midnight breakfast during finals week is not only a fun social event, but it also provides students with free food and a study break. Set up stations at a late-night breakfast bar with pancakes, coffee, cereal, and more to fuel them up for their next all-nighter. Consider partnering with local restaurants or coffee shops to offer a wider variety of options and support small businesses in the process.\n\n\n\n30. Play with puppies\n\n\n\nWhat better way to bring students together than with puppies? Invite some service dogs in training for students to play with and remind them of their furry friends at home. Let your college students take these dogs on a quick walk around campus, play tug o' war with them, or just enjoy petting the various fluffy canines there. They'll appreciate the excuse for a study break! Not only that, but this could be an important opportunity for them to learn about the importance of service animals and how they can support their community by volunteering with local animal organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege events to drive community engagement\n\n\n\n31. Thrifting event\n\n\n\nHost a thrifting event that's all about sustainable fashion and scoring some awesome finds! With help from your local community, fill this thrifting day with racks of unique, gently-used clothing where college students can hunt for their next favorite outfit or that vintage gem they didn't know they needed. It's the perfect way to refresh their wardrobe on a small budget, all while keeping it eco-friendly. Plus, it's a fantastic opportunity to meet fellow fashion-forward students and share style tips.\n\n\n\n32. Charity run\n\n\n\nLace up your running shoes for a good cause! Hosting a charity run around your campus is bound to bring people together in a welcoming college town to rally around supporting nonprofits in your community. It\u2019s the perfect way to spread some positivity, encourage a bit of healthy competition, and, most importantly, raise money for a local charity close to everyone\u2019s hearts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33. Blood drive\n\n\n\nGive the gift of life by organizing a blood drive on campus! Partner with a local blood bank and spread awareness about the importance of donating blood. Not only will this event bring students together for a good cause, but it could also save lives in the process. For students who are able to donate blood at these charity events, offering a variety of prizes such as gift vouchers, exclusive university merchandise, or even free coffee vouchers can serve as great incentives. It'd be thoughtful to offer some free food for them after they're done donating blood as well.\n\n\n\n34. Farmers' market\n\n\n\nLet students browse local vendors from the community for fresh fruit and vegetables, bouquets of flowers, and other locally grown items. You'll not only offering a unique shopping opportunity to your college students, but supporting local restaurants and farmers too! Set up a station where students can even arrange their own beautiful flower bouquet! Like a traditional farmers' market, consider including vendors at your campus farmer's market who sell handcrafted jewelry, art, or clothing as well. Pick a scenic, open spot on campus so it's accessible to everyone (no public transportation needed!) all the time. This market is one event that students won't want to miss!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35. Community service events\n\n\n\nOrganizing community service events is an awesome way to help your students make a real difference in your local area. Whether it\u2019s a park cleanup, volunteering at a local shelter, or being a local charity auction host, there\u2019s something for everyone. Plus, it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for students to step out of their comfort zones, meet new friends, and gain valuable experience for their professional goals as well. Whether it's to raise money for a local nonprofit, donate goods to a shelter, or volunteer some time to help those in need, community service provides powerful college event ideas to develop important skills in your students.\n\n\n\nEducational college events to invite students to\n\n\n\n36. Career fairs\n\n\n\nA career fair not only helps your students kickstart their futures but also brings together vibrant minds and industry leaders under one roof! Imagine creating an event where connections are made and dreams are sparked, all while supporting local businesses. Whether it's in a bustling campus hall or a series of online events, a career fair could be the perfect way to give back, share insights, and maybe even discover the next big talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37. Seminars on professional and life skills\n\n\n\nIn today's competitive job market, employers are looking for well-rounded individuals with strong soft skills as well as technical qualifications. That's why hosting seminars on topics such as time management, communication, leadership, and networking can greatly benefit your students. You could also host workshops to teach students about various practical skills like budgeting, investing, and resume building that'll prepare your students in the long run as well. These events will not only provide valuable knowledge but also help them develop the essential skills needed to succeed in their future careers!\n\n\n\n38. Headshot sessions\n\n\n\nAs students enter the workforce, having a professional headshot can make a big difference in their job search! These types of college events are the perfect way to help prepare your students for the workforce. Offer quick headshot sessions at your university to help them stand out from other candidates. You could partner with local photographers or even have a photography club on campus run these sessions for their peers!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39. Guest speakers\n\n\n\nInvite guest speakers to share their personal stories, inspirational talks, and worldly advice to students on important topics that are relevant to them today. Promote these campus events as your college's local TED Talk or late night talk show hosted by a notable faculty member. These events can be for specific major departments or for the entire university depending on the community members, speakers, and alumni you draw in. Plus, if you have the budget, consider hosting celebrities or social media influencers, as they're sure to draw in a big crowd. Remember to add a Q&amp;A session at the end so students can engage in discussions with your speakers as well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n40. Cooking classes\n\n\n\nHosting a cooking class is a great way for young adults to make new friends while developing practical skills they'll carry with them for the rest of their lives. Invite guest instructors from around campus or from the local restaurant community to host a class and share various cooking tips and tricks. These class levels can range from beginner to advanced, and teach students to make a wide variety of dishes throughout the semester. You can even personalize the courses for Thanksgiving side dishes, Christmas cookies, and more around the holidays. Soon, they'll be making delicious food for all their friends and family!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41. Coffee connect with alumni\n\n\n\nWhat better way to open doors for your students' careers than by connecting them with former students who graduated with the same major? As one of the especially important event ideas for college graduates, this program would provide students the opportunity to chat with alumni over coffee and gain valuable advice about their future careers. This can be done through small group coffee meetups, one-on-one mentorship sessions, or even turn these into virtual events to meet out-of-state alumni. This would not only let students network and gain valuable insights into the job market, but could also open potential opportunities for internships or jobs after graduation!\n\n\n\nWrapping up\n\n\n\nNow, take your favorite college event ideas and run with them! And consider using an intuitive ticketing platform to help you register students and sell out tickets to all your events. With&nbsp;TicketLeap, you'll get free access to all the features you need to keep in touch with students who sign up for your events, manage attendance, and host incredible experiences that will bring your campus to life!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/62a8e9a50f19b73012512a91_college-students-hanging-out-on-campus-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":97,"name":"Event Ideas","slug":"event-ideas","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":97,"taxonomy":"category","description":"<span data-sheets-root=\"1\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Let TicketLeap help you brainstorm for your next awesome event!

Don't worry, we've got your back! Writing a compelling email invitation can help boost your ticket sales and add a personal touch to your marketing strategy. Read on for our team's tips on how to write an effective event email invitation that'll have your attendees counting down to your big day.\n\n\n\nThe audience of your invitations\n\n\n\nBefore we deep dive into how to write your emails, you'll need to determine what audience you're writing to. More specifically, are you writing to prospective attendees or returning guests? This distinction will help you create invitations in a way that best resonates with them. For first-timers, ensure your branding and logo are clearly displayed to establish your organization as a trusted source. For returning guests, try offering an exclusive discount or early access to tickets as a way of saying thank you for showing their support or referring a friend. Keep these differences in mind as you craft each email invitation for event-goers, and your event will be one they can't resist!\n\n\n\nThe 5 key ingredients of your invitation email\n\n\n\nNow that you know who you're writing to, let's discuss how to best write each element of a successful event invite email:\n\n\n\n1. Subject line\n\n\n\nSince this is the first piece of text that people will see, your event email subject lines make a big difference in whether they open your email or not. You want it to be catchy and to the point, ideally nine words or less. Throwing in an emoji or two can also help grab their attention. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\"Ready to Party? \ud83c\udf89 Join Us at Scottfield's New Year's Gala!\"\n\n\n\n\"Don't Miss 2023 Sporting Conference's Award-Winning Speakers! \ud83e\udd29\"\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these examples include a benefit of attending and the event name, while remaining both exciting and brief. Subject lines can also create a sense of urgency with phrases such as \u201cAct Fast!\u201d or \u201cDon't Miss Out!\u201d (like in the second example).\n\n\n\nAnother best practice is to personalize the subject line with the recipient's name (e.g., \u201cHi Rachel, You're Invited!\u201d) to add an even more personal touch to your message. You should also try out different subject lines with&nbsp;A\/B testing&nbsp;and see which ones get the most clicks. Give it a go and see what works best for your event!\n\n\n\n2. Headline\n\n\n\nNow that you've crafted an effective subject line for your event invitation email, it's time to focus on your headline. A headline is the title within your email (just above the main text) that works hand in hand with your subject line. Instead of repeating what you already said in the subject line, use this text to shine the spotlight on other details about your event that'll peak your reader's interest. Plus, you want your headline to naturally flow into the body of your email. For instance, if you were hosting a beer festival, the headline \u201cTap Into a World of Flavor on June 20th!\" would be the perfect headline for the subject line \u201cAdam, You're Invited to the Copperridge Brew Fest! \ud83c\udf7b\u201d.\n\n\n\n3. Email copy\n\n\n\nWhen writing the body of your email, first things first, make sure to place all the important details near the top. This includes your date, time, location, and duration of your event. That way, it'll be easy to find this info later without having to scroll through your email. Keep your message short and sweet, highlighting the value of attending your event in a way that's easy to digest. Highlight the featured activities you have lined up, your roster of special guests, or any&nbsp;additional perks they might get for attending. If there's other essential info for your specific event, like a dress code or registration details, this is the place to do so. And remember, depending on who your&nbsp;target audience&nbsp;is, make sure your language and tone of voice speaks directly to them.\n\n\n\n4. Call-to-action\n\n\n\nThis call-to-action (CTA) button prompts the reader to take a specific action, such as \"Buy Tickets\" or \"Subscribe Now.\" You'll want to ensure this action is easy to understand (e.g., click a link, watch a video, buy a ticket). Then, use bold colors, larger sizes, and simple wording so the button itself easily catches the reader's eye. We recommend placing your primary CTA above the fold or just below the text of all your most important event details. Design recognizable links that are underlined or use a contrasting color with hover effects and cursor changes so readers know your CTA is a clickable element.\n\n\n\nAnd be sure to&nbsp;install tracking codes&nbsp;(called UTM parameters) to your links! For your ticketing pages specifically, you can&nbsp;set up Google Analytics&nbsp;or another third-party tracking tool straight to these links using TicketLeap. This will give you valuable information about those who click your CTA to help you assess the effectiveness of each email and conduct remarketing campaigns. You may want to consider having a secondary CTA (like \u201cLearn More\u201d) that provides the reader with more information about your event or organization, should they need some extra persuading before purchasing their tickets.\n\n\n\n5. Design\n\n\n\nDesigning your email invites in a super sleek, engaging way can help win your email recipients over! You should especially highlight your organization's logo, colors, font, and other branding elements throughout the email. That way, you'll build credibility with your readers, increase brand recognition, and create a cohesive look in your invite that's visually appealing. And don't forget to include some high-quality images of your upcoming events to hype up your readers too! Plus, between each section of your invite, you'd be surprised how adding some white space can make your email easier to read, as well as create a sense of balance and structure.\n\n\n\nOne last thing: it's important to remember that most people will be opening your email on their mobile devices, so double check that your design is mobile-friendly. With a ticketing platform like TicketLeap, your emails are automatically optimized for display on smaller screens!\n\n\n\nNow that you're an event invitation email wizard, you'll be creating invites that not only look awesome but also drive conversions. And imagine how easy this is with an intuitive ticketing platform that can manage your email blasts for you!

On top of capturing unforgettable memories, event photography is a powerful tool for curating the perfect promotional materials to sell out events! If you follow our event photography tips, you and your staff will snap awesome photos without needing to budget for a professional photographer. Read on to learn how to take your skills up a notch, using only your phone.\n\n\n\n1. Create a photography shot list&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUsing your event's agenda for reference, put together a shot list that maps out all the key moments throughout the day. Whether it's a guest speaker or an opening act, you'll know when and where to be so you'll capture the perfect shot. This is just a starting point though! While your shot list is a helpful guide, there are plenty of other photos you'll need for your\u00a0Instagram stories\u00a0and other social posts. In between your main event programming, keep your eyes peeled for photo ops of event goers having a blast. This can include your attendees singing along with your artists, picking up delicious food from your vendors, or getting into the competitive spirit while playing lawn games.\n\n\n\n2. Get creative with shots&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow that you've planned out your event photography ideas, make sure you're getting a variety of photos that feel organic and that best represent your event experience, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCandid\n\n\n\nSome of the most powerful shots you'll take are organic reactions of your attendees enjoying your event. However, getting these candid photographs is all about timing. Because they're unplanned and capture people fully immersed in the moment, you'll need to keep a keen eye out for these picture-perfect moments!\n\n\n\nPosed\n\n\n\nThroughout your event, find groups of attendees who are ready to strike a pose for an impromptu photoshoot. Be sure to tell them you're part of the event staff and that they might make it on your social media accounts. If you need to help loosen them up in front of the camera, give them a compliment or ask how they're enjoying your event. This will create a more relaxed atmosphere for posed photos and make your guests feel more comfortable!\n\n\n\nBurst\n\n\n\nBurst photos are a great way to capture things that happen in the blink of an eye. For example, if you're hosting a haunted attraction, this feature is perfect for action shots or even a jump scare! To do this on an iPhone, slide the camera button to the left, and it'll immediately start taking photos in burst mode. Android phones can vary, but some allow you to hold down the camera button to start taking burst photos.\n\n\n\nTripod\n\n\n\nA tripod is the tried-and-true method for combating shaky hands to take flawless photos. Simply set up your tripod, get a clear line of sight to your subject, then snap away! This is useful for high res crowd shots, performances at a central location or stage, or low light events like a late night sports game or haunted attraction.\n\n\n\n3. Arrive early&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs an emerging shutterbug who's learning the ropes of photography for events, you'll want to stay on top of your game! Set aside time during your\u00a0pre-event preparations\u00a0to get a lay of the land and make a plan to complete your shot list. Not only will you be able to snap a few shots of the event setup you've worked so hard on, you'll also be ready to photograph your attendees' reactions when they first walk through the gate.\n\n\n\n4. Change perspectives&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWant to add some extra flair to your camera roll? Experimenting with your camera angles can help you to get a more diverse portfolio of photos when shooting events. For example, in addition to taking pictures of attendees, snag some detail shots of what they're doing or where they are. This is especially fitting for more intimate venues like a cooking class or wine tasting. For larger events, be sure to take some aerial shots of an excited crowd or a busy exhibit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Find the right lighting&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember, when it comes to taking professional-looking event photos, good lighting is not just a bright idea, it's a must have! As a golden rule, take advantage of natural light whenever you can. This is especially important if you don't have room in your budget for on-the-go lighting equipment like rings lights. Simply position yourself so the light is in front of your attendees, illuminating them and avoiding unnecessary shadows. If you do need to use flash, don't let your guests feel like a deer in headlights! Angle your camera slightly so the light isn't directly facing them. That way, you'll avoid red eyes from the flash hitting them head-on.\n\n\n\n6. Check your camera settings&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow that you've mastered how to photograph events using burst and flash photos, there's so much more you can do! Spend some time experimenting with your different camera features, like portrait mode, panorama, or high dynamic range (HDR). Want to photograph vivid imagery? HDR can help colors appear more vibrant and capture details in dark lighting. Want to put your attendees in the spotlight? Portrait mode is great for putting your subjects in sharp focus with a blurred background. Need to capture a large group that doesn't quite fit in frame? Panorama shots are the solution. Those are just a few of our favorites, but there's&nbsp;plenty more options&nbsp;to discover!\n\n\n\n7. Utilize the Rule of Thirds\n\n\n\nTake the guesswork out of your framing! Use the&nbsp;Rule of Thirds&nbsp;to perfectly frame your subject and draw viewers in with more dynamic shots. To do this, imagine your image is cut into nine equal squares, like a tic-tac-toe board. Place your subject in the left or right third of your shot while leaving the other two thirds open. This makes your photos more balanced against the background and draws attention to your subject. To make this easier, turn on gridlines in your phone's camera settings to place faint lines over your phone screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Portray a unified message&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember to keep your event's purpose in mind so you can tell a cohesive story through your photos. You want them to perfectly represent your event and tie into your\u00a0event marketing strategy. For example, if you're hosting a local community event, your photos should highlight how you're bringing people together. Even the way you edit your images should fit the feel of your event! If you're hosting a color run, you don't want to post your photos in black and white, right?\n\n\n\n9. Be a fly on the wall\n\n\n\nThe best event photographers are like ninjas \u2013 they're masters of going unnoticed. Your goal should be to take the perfect pictures without distracting from the event or blocking any attendee's view. You may need to be swift in maneuvering around crowds, dress for the occasion without drawing attention to yourself (many photographers opt for an all black outfit), and visualize your plan of action before getting into position. Master the art of blending in, and you'll catch those genuine event moments that attendees will remember for years to come.\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve used our tips for event photography to get tons of new photos, show them off on your next event listing using TicketLeap! Our intuitive ticketing system is packed with easy-to-use features to help create awesome events.

There is so much opportunity to save time and gain valuable insight from your ticket buyers, only using a sign up form is a missed opportunity. With a user-friendly event registration tool or platform, you don't just get one tool \u2014 you get a whole toolbox with all the registration features you need to manage your event from start to finish. Let's take a look at just a few of these top event management tools and what they can do for your event.\n\n\n\nEvent listing builder\n\n\n\nUse your registration platform's template to create a beautiful, custom event page in just a few minutes \u2013 no web design skills required. With an event website, your attendees can find and register for your event online, on any device. Since the listing is customizable, you can include your organization's logo, your brand colors, plus add your own images and videos. If you have more than one event, you can list them all on your online event calendar so all your events are in one place. Attendees will see this calendar as your homepage and can register for multiple events at the same time, with one convenient checkout process.\n\n\n\nEvent promotion and marketing tools\n\n\n\nOnce you've set up your custom event registration page, you now have a link to post on any social media platform to get the word out and increase event registrations. Sharing your event listing with friends via text message or replying to messages on social media, is as easy as copy and paste. Optimize your event management processes by using your platform's email blast feature which will allow you to let your attendees know about important event details and updates. Use a post-purchase message to get your registrants to follow you on other social media platforms or run a contest with an incentive to have them share your online event registration link with their followers. Discount codes are another great promotional tool \u2013 offer loyalty codes to previous buyers, or give local influencers promo codes that they can promote as an exclusive perk to their audiences. Custom ticket types allow you to offer early bird registration discounts or VIP tickets, and custom tickets are also a way to sell merchandise or meals at your specific event.\n\n\n\nSecure credit card payments\n\n\n\nOnline event registration software means you'll need a secure way to accept credit card payments for online ticketing. A top event registration platform integrates the payment processor of your choice into your event registration page, so you can easily sell tickets online. This eliminates the hassle of trying to set up a payment processing system of your own on your site or calling ticket buyers to get their credit card information to complete the purchase. If you're selling tickets at the door, you can accept credit card payments using a credit card swiper and an easy-to-use app on your mobile device. These tools are also great for any merchandise or equipment you'll be selling onsite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReports to track event registration and ticket sales\n\n\n\nAs soon as your first attendee registers for your event, your registration platform begins compiling registration data into detailed reports that you can schedule for delivery to your email inbox or view instantly anytime. Get valuable information at a glance \u2013 see sales totals, popular event dates and times, and discount codes used, just to name a few. Use your data reports to measure the success of your event and make your future events bigger and better.\n\n\n\nEvent attendee data collection\n\n\n\nDuring the event registration process, your ticketing platform gathers basic information about your attendees, like names and email addresses. If you need to know a bit more about your audience before your event so you can plan things more thoroughly, your event registration platform can help with that, too. Use a checkout questionnaire to gather information during the event registration form process about anything from t-shirt sizes to dietary needs \u2013 if you've got questions, this is how to get answers.\n\n\n\nEvent day registration and check-in\n\n\n\nThere's more than one way to check in attendees on the day of your event, and a registration platform lets you choose the one that's right for you. Electronic check-in will get your guests in the door faster, which might be the right fit if your event has a larger guest list. If you opt for electronic check-in, you can use your registration platform's app to scan your attendees' tickets (they can print tickets or display them on a mobile device) or look them up by name. Since your platform automatically generates an attendee list of everyone who's registered, you can also print out this list and check off names as your attendees arrive. If you're going for a more personalized check-in process, where you'd like to put a face to each name, then printing off your attendee information list and checking people in the old-fashioned way might be the better solution for you.\n\n\n\nPost-event follow-up\n\n\n\nYour event might be over, but your registration platform is still working hard for you. Review your reports and use your data insights to start planning your next event. The data you collected from your attendees when they registered will be valuable as you look ahead to your next event. And don't forget to send an email blast using your registration platform's email tool to thank your attendees for coming, give them follow-up information, or promote your next big event.The best part of using a registration platform? The tools we mentioned above are just the tip of the iceberg.

Attendees may see your ticket price as a deciding factor on whether or not to attend your event. Plus, setting the right price for your expected number of guests will help cover the costs of hosting your event and allow you to put your profits towards the next one. Ready to get started? Our pricing guide is here with advice to help you research, set your price, and decide what strategy is right for you!\n\n\n\nStep 1: Do your research\n\n\n\nAs you get ready to&nbsp;sell your tickets, be sure to read up on similar events to yours and look back to previous events you've hosted. This will help you gauge how many people you can expect will attend your latest event and what price they'd be willing to pay for your tickets. More specifically, here are two ways to determine your event pricing:\n\n\n\nCompare to competitors\n\n\n\nLook up events in your area on Google and across social media. Once you've found relevant events, take a look at their ticket prices. When doing this though, be aware that various factors (e.g., time of year, location, their talent lineup) could significantly impact the price and offerings of seemingly \u201csimilar\u201d events. Therefore, don't treat these comparisons as hard and fast rules; do what makes sense for your event!\n\n\n\nSurvey your community\n\n\n\nYou don't have to brave this alone! Ask people in your target audience what they'd be willing to pay for your event. If you've done events before, reach out to past attendees or revisit their feedback from previous&nbsp;post-event surveys. If you're the new event in town, ask locals to share their thoughts using some guided questions prepared ahead of time such as:\n\n\n\n\nHow much would you pay for tickets to this kind of event?\n\n\n\nOnce you've got your tickets, how much extra would you be willing to spend onsite (for parking, food, drinks, etc.)?\n\n\n\nAt this given ticket price, what would your expectations of the event be like?\n\n\n\nHow far out of your way would you go to attend an event like this?\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate your ticket pricing\n\n\n\nPricing your tickets is one of the hardest decisions of an event organizer, especially for first-timers. But rest assured: there is no single right answer for the \u201cbest\u201d price. Instead, think of your ticket pricing as numbers you will continually assess, test, and adapt to what your audience wants.\n\n\n\nFirst, use the projected expenses from the budget you've created while&nbsp;planning your event&nbsp;to determine how much revenue you'll need to break even. Take this number plus the extra you hope to make in profit, and divide that total by your expected number of attendees to gauge the average price per ticket you'd like to make. However, while this is a good rule of thumb, understand these numbers are bound to change over time, particularly as you account for additional ticket types.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStep 3: Pick your ticket types\n\n\n\nOne size may not fit all when it comes to&nbsp;pricing tickets. Having various price levels can ensure there's an option for everyone, so more people can come out to your event. Plus, offering multiple types could make the less expensive tickets seem more affordable, while the more expensive tickets look more VIP. Amidst the many options available, here's a few key ticket types that many organizers use:\n\n\n\nGeneral admission\n\n\n\nThese are your most important tickets! They're on sale for the longest amount of time and are the baseline for pricing your discount and premium tickets.\n\n\n\nVIP\n\n\n\nFrom front-row seats to meet &amp; greets with your lineup, these premium-priced tickets are the perfect upgrade for your current audience and for newcomers wanting a first-class experience they won't forget.\n\n\n\nMulti-day or one-day passes\n\n\n\nIf your event spans multiple days, offering this ticket type allows attendees the flexibility to choose which days they sign up for based on their availability.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Determine your ticket pricing strategy\n\n\n\nNow that you've got your ticket offerings solidified, as part of your&nbsp;event marketing strategy, you'll need to figure out how you'll incentivize people to buy their tickets ahead of time. This is because, in reality, 50% of tickets don't usually sell until the week of the actual event. Enter: the discount. When used effectively, this powerful tool can solve this issue and motivate attendees to secure their tickets ASAP!\n\n\n\nThe key to an effective discount strategy is being selective. There are a lot of discount options out there, so focus on offering one or a small combination of them to kick your ticket sales into high gear. To help you get the ball rolling, here are some event discount ideas to amp up your event promotion!\n\n\n\n1. Early-bird tickets\n\n\n\nReward your most proactive ticket buyers for buying their tickets before your entire event lineup is announced. Plus, selling lots of early-bird tickets will help give you peace of mind as you pay for deposits and finalize your event budget.\n\n\n\n2. Referral discounts\n\n\n\nWord of mouth is one of the most powerful marketing strategies, so take advantage of it by rewarding people for inviting friends and family to your event! You can also reach out to influencers and provide them with a personalized discount code to share with their followers.\n\n\n\n3. Group deals\n\n\n\nOffer a discounted rate to customers who buy their tickets in bulk for a large group. Because the amount of marketing you need to sell the rest of those tickets is reduced, you're saving money and able to pass those savings onto your ticket buyers.\n\n\n\n4. First-time discounts\n\n\n\nGive your first-time customers the opportunity to save a little extra on one of your ticket types. This will encourage newcomers to check things out and build trust with your organization, while staying on track towards your revenue goals with the rest of your ticket types.\n\n\n\n5. Exclusive ticket upgrades\n\n\n\nSell your more premium tickets at a discount for a limited time to incentivize customers to splurge a little. This is especially effective for people who are on the fence about whether to upgrade their tickets or not.\n\n\n\n6. Bundles\n\n\n\nIf you have an event series, you can bundle upcoming events with your current one (e.g., offer a discount for buying tickets to your next three events) to encourage and reward loyalty. You can also sell bundles of perks like parking passes, meal vouchers, or merchandise with your ticket.\n\n\n\n7. Plan-ahead pricing\n\n\n\nBy telling customers your tickets will be cheaper now than on the day of your event, they'll want to grab tickets fast before that price bump kicks in. Plus, selling tickets at the door for a higher price can help increase your event's perceived value (e.g., $49 online in advance versus $99 at the door).\n\n\n\nWith so many options out there, no two ticket pricing strategies are the same. What's successful for one event type could look totally different for another. Therefore, be selective with your event pricing and the discounts you choose, tailoring to what best suits your event. And remember to always be improving. With an&nbsp;intuitive ticketing platform&nbsp;like TicketLeap, you can pull reports to help assess which tickets you're selling the most of and which discounts are being used. That way, you can be confident you're maximizing your ticket sales and on track to making your next event a smash hit!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6481f89aa14c4ca683709f1c_person-stacking-money-coins-scaled-1-1024x614.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

Whether you're the event organizer of a farm, orchard, school, or another organization, hosting fall events is a surefire way to draw in excited attendees and drive more revenue at the height of the season. Looking for ways to level up your event with some extra fall-related fun? We've got some fall activity ideas for you to try!\n\n\n\n1. Pumpkin carving\n\n\n\nHelp your attendees get into the spirit of fall (and Halloween!) with a pumpkin carving station. Besides pumpkins of course, you'll need spoons for gutting your pumpkins, stencils and markers for attendees to plan what they'll carve, and carving utensils to bring that vision to life. If you need to save some time, consider having the pumpkins pre-gutted so attendees can get straight to carving. You could also put out some acrylic paints so they can paint their pumpkin and give it an even more personal touch! Once they're done, display the pumpkins somewhere at your venue and even host a friendly competition with prizes for the best pumpkin masterpieces. Then, at the end of the day, let your attendees take theirs home, giving them a one-of-a-kind souvenir from your event!\n\n\n\n2. Bonfire\n\n\n\nAs the sun sets and the air gets a bit chilly, bonfires are a fan favorite addition for outdoor venues. It's a unique way to foster community, bringing attendees together to share spooky stories, enjoy some s'mores, and maybe even have a jam session with some of your event's performers! As one of your fall festival ideas, this could be the ideal setting for an afterparty to wind down from the main festivities earlier that day. You could build one large fire or a few smaller ones (depending on the size of your event), set up chairs, and sell s'mores supplies. Don't forget to check that your venue permits bonfires, and make sure to have a\u00a0staff member\u00a0watching it at all times. You'll also want to consult with your state and city's open burn regulations, as well as any local ordinances.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3. Cider tasting\n\n\n\nNothing screams fall like a hot cup of apple cider! Set up a cider station for people to enjoy, along with some extra options to spice up their drink (like orange zest, cinnamon sticks, or apple slices). Your cider tasting can also be the perfect time to celebrate Oktoberfest, with beer and hard cider tastings (definitely among popular fall festival activities for adults)! You could get\u00a0your sponsors\u00a0and local vendors involved too, letting them share samples of their drinks with your attendees and help them get their products out there.\n\n\n\n4. Candy corner\n\n\n\nTrick-or-treating isn't the only time for filling up on candy! As a sure hit among kids or adults with a sweet tooth, having a booth for building your own bag of festive candy can be a tasty addition to your event. You could include candy corn, gummies, butterscotch, chocolate covered pretzels, and other candies in an assortment of reds, yellows, and oranges to match the fall atmosphere. Set the candy out in decorative containers with tongs or serving spoons, with clear bags for people to fill to the brim. You could also try a candy apple bar where attendees dip their own apples (either slices or whole apples) into caramel before covering it with toppings like peanuts, sprinkles, or chocolate chips. You'll want to be mindful of any potential nut allergies, so consider sending\u00a0registration questions\u00a0about them to your attendees to accommodate accordingly.\u200d\n\n\n\n5. Flower bouquet station\n\n\n\nLet your event-goers build a beautiful bouquet at a flower bar, complete with seasonal flowers like sunflowers, chrysanthemums, and warm-colored roses. Set the flowers out in pales or wooden crates, with labels on them in case anyone's curious what kind of flowers they are. Add other fall items for the bouquets at your station, like colorful autumn leaves or pine cones. These flowers could be wrapped in paper or burlap, set in mason jars, or even be placed inside a small carved out pumpkin. It'll be a perfect decoration to take home that your attendees are sure to tell their friends about!\u200d\n\n\n\n6. Fall-themed photo ops\n\n\n\nChannel your\u00a0inner photographer, and build a cute photo booth at your venue that's decked out in tons of fall-related decorations. It'll be a perfect spot for attendees to capture some memorable moments at your event. Pick your location (e.g., in front of some barn doors or a wagon) and decorate it with things like pumpkins, string lights, hay bales, or warm-colored balloons. You could even reuse some old rustic doors as a\u00a0sustainable option. Consider stringing a banner across the backdrop with a witty phrase about fall and\/or your brand name. Remember, this is a prime opportunity for your\u00a0event marketing! So, encourage people to tag your Instagram, Facebook, or other social media accounts when they post their photos with your backdrop.\n\n\n\n7. Barn dancing\n\n\n\nTime to pull out those cowboy boots! For this fall activity, all you need is a big open floor, whether under a pavilion, outside on a flat surface, or in an actual barn. Hire a caller who'll teach your attendees different square dances, line dances, and other fun moves to do. You can have a live band or DJ playing the music they'll dance along to. This'll build community and create fond memories for all your attendees, giving them a chance to chat (and dance!) with fellow event-goers they may not have met otherwise.\u200d\n\n\n\n8. Carnival games\n\n\n\nLooking for some fall event ideas that are fun for the whole family? Try throwing a carnival at your event! Add fall-themed games like bobbing for apples or pumpkin bowling, or classic carnival games like a ring toss or dunk tank. You could also offer face painting or a craft corner for kids to make some festive fall-related crafts. If you're\u00a0hosting an event on a farm, this is the perfect opportunity to offer pony rides or open up a small petting zoo for people to visit. You could also rent a mechanical bull for the adults to try, and watch as they embark on a wild ride!\n\n\n\n\u200d\n\n\n\nFalling for any of these fall event ideas yet? Give some of them a try and level up your\u00a0next fall event. Then, as you're planning your event, consider using TicketLeap's user-friendly platform to sell your tickets!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64b7e91114c1856836e7dd40_two-girls-carving-pumpkins-scaled-1-1024x733.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":97,"name":"Event Ideas","slug":"event-ideas","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":97,"taxonomy":"category","description":"<span data-sheets-root=\"1\" data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Let TicketLeap help you brainstorm for your next awesome event!

During haunt season, many event organizers are on the lookout for spooky Halloween decorating ideas that'll also save them some money. Here are a few DIY Halloween decorations that are simple and perfect for your haunted attraction!\n\n\n\n1. Creepy coffin\n\n\n\nFor this spooky Halloween decoration, outline the pieces of your coffin on cardboard, foam board, or wood to cut out (templates are super helpful here!). Then, use tape, nails, or spray-on adhesive to secure the pieces together. Once everything is glued and dried, select a color to spray paint your coffin with. After your paint is done drying, here comes the fun part! Decorate your&nbsp;creepy coffin&nbsp;with chains, skulls, or any other scary item that comes to mind. Take it up a notch by adding LED lights on the inside to make your coffin glow from within!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Ghastly candle centerpieces&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGather up some pool noodles and cut them at varying lengths. The longest piece will determine how tall your&nbsp;ghastly candle centerpiece&nbsp;is. Depending on how large you want your centerpiece to be, group together between 3-5 pieces at a time, and use a hot glue gun on a low setting to glue your pieces together. Then, once they're dry, use your glue gun to add droplets running down the outer room of your pool noodles to recreate the look of candle wax dripping. When that's all squared away, spray-paint your pool noodles in the color of your choosing and even spice it up with some glitter that matches your event's theme. Finally, top off your candles with small LED flameless candles to bring your candle centerpiece to life!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Petrifying pumpkin doorway\n\n\n\nFirst, measure how long and wide you want your&nbsp;pumpkin-covered entryway&nbsp;to be. Using those measurements, piece together PVC pipes and their connectors to build the outline of your doorway. Then, secure the arch you've just built to the actual doorway of your event using zip ties or heavy-duty clear tape. Next, buy some hollow plastic pumpkins in varying colors and cut out two holes in the back on opposite sides of each pumpkin. Use zip ties to loop through those holes and secure your pumpkins around the arch until it's completely covered. Lastly, loop through some LED lights and fill in any sparse areas of the archway with dark-colored garland to complete the final look.\n\n\n\n4. Bone-chilling spider webs&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat's more spine-tingling than being surrounded by&nbsp;spiderwebs? To give your attendees the creepy crawlies, start by placing clear thumbtacks in the wall in the shape of a spider web. These will be the spokes for your web. Use orange, white, or black yarn found in your local craft store and hook around the spokes to weave a spider web. Be sure to add a plastic spider on each web as a finishing touch. If you're looking to really give your attendees the willies, get some stretchy fake cobwebs to cover your venue from top to bottom with!\n\n\n\n5. Perilous potion bottles\n\n\n\nThis decoration idea is a perfect way to reuse some simple household items for your spooky Halloween decorating while also\u00a0practicing sustainability! To start, gather up some glass jars or bottles in different sizes. Fill your \u201cpotion bottles\u201d with water and add food coloring in various colors to each. If you want to make your potions look extra convincing, add some extra elements like sprinkling glitter or bits of colored styrofoam into each bottle. You could also put herbs or other plants in jars that'll look like mysterious ingredients for your potions. Lastly, get creative and label your bottles with clever names like \u201cVicious Venom\u201d or \u201cImmortal Elixir\u201d. Considering how simple they are to make, feel free to create as many of these spooky Halloween decorations as you'd like!\n\n\n\n6. Wicked witch parking&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis one is super simple and hilarious! All you need to do is gather up a few brooms (and a witch hat or two!) and find an area in your venue's parking lot to place them. To add to the fun, label the area \u201cWicked Witch Parking,\u201d \u201cDesignated Witch Parking,\u201d or another creative name. Rather than use a parking space, you could also\u00a0hang some brooms on a wall\u00a0with a sign saying \u201cBroom Parking Only.\u201d It'll be sure to get a laugh out of your attendees after spooking them all night long! Pro tip: Snap some candid photos of attendees' reactions throughout your event to include in your\u00a0haunt marketing materials.\n\n\n\n7. Lifeless flower bouquets\n\n\n\nPurchase a few bouquets of flowers with varieties (like roses, hydrangeas, or lavender) that don't drop their petals easily. Wrap your flowers in bundles of 8-10 using a twist tie or rubber band, then hang them upside down from either a clothes hanger or hook to dry. Next, place them in a dark, dry location away from sunlight. A closet or garage will do the trick! After 2-3 weeks, your&nbsp;dried flowers&nbsp;will be ready to place in your vases. As an idea, you can try spray-painting your flowers black if you want, especially on the stems and leaves. Finally, to make your elegant Halloween decorations fit in more with your event's theme, finish your bouquets off with unconventional items like cobwebs or twigs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Ominous old pictures\n\n\n\nLike in most horror movies, ominous old family pictures hang from the walls that'll give you the chills! Recreate this feeling with your Halloween event decorations by looking up some vintage family pictures online and printing them in black and white. Get a&nbsp;few dusty frames&nbsp;to place them in and cover them with cobwebs or a splatter of red paint to give the illusion of blood. Who knew scary Halloween decorations could be so easy!\n\n\n\n9. Ghoulish ghosts\n\n\n\nFor this haunting decoration, pick up a ton of styrofoam heads and cheesecloth at your local craft store. To turn them into ghosts, simply drape the long, flowing pieces of cloth over each head and hang them from the ceiling. There you have it,\u00a0ghoulish ghosts\u00a0in a matter of seconds! One more thing: as part of\u00a0keeping your haunted attraction safe, remember to hang your ghosts high enough to ensure a clear path for your attendees to walk through.\n\n\n\nNow that we've got your creative juices flowing, let's get a jump start on planning your haunted attraction! Sign up with a ticketing platform like\u00a0TicketLeap, that'll equip you with a full suite of\u00a0haunt ticketing features\u00a0for your next event.

As they venture through your haunted attraction, you'll want procedures in place that'll ensure your event runs smoothly and everyone is safe at all times (so there are no actual scares on our watch!). That way, your attendees can simply get lost in the spine-chilling experience and have the best time possible. Ready to learn more? Let's uncover the secrets of hosting a terrifying haunt that's also a safe and secure one!\n\n\n\n1. Conduct a risk assessment&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo conduct a risk assessment, record&nbsp;any potential hazards&nbsp;like uneven flooring, low ceilings, sharp edges, and poor lighting to help you keep an eye out for (and prevent!) any accidents from happening. As you analyze your event space, consider how likely these hazards are to occur and what prevention steps you might take. Also, consider the number and types of guests attending (including kids and the elderly), how your actors will move around, and the different scare elements involved. By recording this information and using it to make informed safety decisions, you'll be on your way to creating a safe and enjoyable haunted attraction.\n\n\n\n2. Develop a safety plan\n\n\n\nTo kick off your safety plan, start by reviewing the risk assessment you just put together. Outline well-defined emergency procedures for incidents like fires, severe weather, or medical emergencies, as well as implement effective security measures to handle them. Make sure pathways and exits are made clear, and your props and sets are securely in place so attendees don't accidentally trip as they walk through. It's also a smart idea to map out your haunt with clear markers to the nearest exits. You can share a copy of this map with your attendees prior to the event, as well as post it around your haunt. Depending on the types of scares you have in store, you may need to obtain permits or licenses, like a special effects license or a fire safety permit, for your haunt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Implement fire safety measures\n\n\n\nTo create a super safe haunted attraction, implementing fire safety measures is absolutely essential. For one, install fire extinguishers in easily accessible locations throughout your venue and regularly inspect them to ensure they're in top-notch condition (most need to be replaced roughly every two years). If you need additional insight, reach out to your local fire department for recommendations on where to place them. Prior to\u00a0event day, you should also test and replace the batteries in your fire alarm systems as needed. Remember to have a well-prepared emergency plan that includes when and how to evacuate for any potential fire incidents.\n\n\n\n4. Provide full training for staff and actors\n\n\n\nOn top of bringing your scary experience to life, your\u00a0staff members\u00a0are also responsible for knowing how to provide a safe experience for your guests. Leading up to event day, dedicate time to go over your safety plan and emergency protocols with them. For smooth coordination, establish who their primary and secondary points of contact are in case of an emergency and how to quickly reach them (e.g., cell phone, walkie-talkies). For your actors specifically, they should receive specific training on proper scare techniques and guest interaction (like whether or not they are allowed to touch attendees). Plus, make sure your actors have costumes and makeup that don't hinder their vision or mobility, allowing them to deliver their spine-tingling performances flawlessly.\n\n\n\n\u200d5. Communicate safety instructions clearly\n\n\n\nAs potential attendees get ready to buy their tickets, ensure your website and\u00a0event ticketing page\u00a0clearly inform buyers of your scare intensity level and any age restrictions so everyone has a spooktacular time. Once they've secured their tickets to your haunting experience, you should also send them an email with any important safety instructions and emergency protocols they may need to know beforehand. It's also super important to display signs throughout your attraction that remind guests of your safety guidelines as well. You'll want to hear from your guests too! Because their feedback is valuable in keeping your experience safe for all, encourage them to report any concerns they may have to you and your staff.\u00a0\n\n\n\n6. Have attendees sign your waiver\n\n\n\nWith TicketLeap's full suite of\u00a0haunt ticketing features, adding waivers and building comprehensive event pages are a breeze! On your event page, you'll want to include any important information upfront about expectations regarding the spooky nature of your haunt and any rules your attendees need to abide by, like not being allowed to touch actors. You'll want to disclose any effects of your haunted attraction that may not be suitable for those with certain medical conditions. For instance, make sure to specify if you use any strobe lights that could trigger a seizure. With TicketLeap, you can seamlessly embed your waiver into the checkout process for your ticket buyers to sign when purchasing their tickets, so you know everyone's on the same page!\n\n\n\n7. Hire professional security\n\n\n\nTo help maintain order and swiftly address any potential threats that come up, you should hire trained security professionals as part of your event's team. Your security personnel can monitor lines to preemptively identify any disturbances and\u00a0look out for ticket scalpers. For an extra layer of security and your attendees' peace of mind, consider implementing bag checks and metal detectors at your haunt's entrance too. With professional security personnel on board, you can rest assured that your guests' safety is in capable hands and can focus on delivering your most thrilling experience to date!\n\n\n\n8. Manage crowd flow\n\n\n\nIn order to control the number of attendees enjoying the thrills of your haunt at any given time, implement timed entry ticketing (part of TicketLeap's\u00a0complete set of features!) so your attendees can select the best time to come to your event. This will help you stay within the capacity limit of your venue, ensuring a safe, comfortable experience for everyone. Depending on the size of your haunt, set up multiple check-in areas using stanchions, floor tape, or spray paint (if you're outside) to differentiate your lines, help direct your crowd, and prevent any overcrowding. By following these crowd management strategies, you'll be well on your way to creating a haunting event that flows seamlessly from start to finish.\n\n\n\nReady to take your haunted attraction to the next level?

Try sending a few personalized invites to people you want at your event. Show them how they would benefit from attending. To make it easy for them to share, type up a few posts that include the event page URL and event hashtag that they can easily copy and paste and post to their networks.\n\n\n\nGet press\n\n\n\nFirst, figure out who you want to write or talk about your event tickets to. What does your target audience read, or do they listen to radio more? Do they like newspapers, blogs, radio stations? Maybe it's worth seeing if you can be added to a list of weekly or monthly events happening in your city or town. Once you narrow down the specific media outlets you want to cover your event, find out the individuals covering topics similar to yours -- these are the people you're going to actually contact.\n\n\n\nThen, write your own story around the event using the 5 W's: who, what, when, where, and why. Or, at least create a fact sheet for your event using the same criteria. This will give the author a clear guideline of what they should write about - making their jobs easier, and more likely they will actually write about your upcoming event.\n\n\n\nWhen sending your pitch,&nbsp;take the time to make it personalized, like you actually read and enjoy the other pieces they have written. If you do not get a response, wait a few days to a week to email them again asking if they received your original email. Getting press can take some time, so you want to start early, even a few months before your event.\n\n\n\nPaid advertisements\n\n\n\nIf you have a little bit of money to spend, try some Facebook ads. You can target the people you want to attend your event and spend just a few dollars a day. If you have a mailing list of people who've attended previous events, Facebook has a cool tool called&nbsp;Lookalike Audiences. Upload the mailing list, and Facebook will display your ad to people with similar likes and interests.\n\n\n\nOffline\n\n\n\nEveryone talks about what you can do online, but don't forget about offline opportunities. Try printing and hanging eye-catching and informative flyers in places that will reach your target market. In addition to a brief description of your event, be sure to include the location, date and time,\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0(advance and door price), URL to purchase event tickets online, and any age or other restrictions.\n\n\n\nIn real life\n\n\n\nThis one may sound obvious, but talk about your event to the people you know! Don't assume the people you meet in person have read about your event online. Another option is to talk to people at other, similar events. We don't recommend treating other events as an opportunity to advertise your event, but we definitely can encourage you to invite people in one-on-one conversations.\n\n\n\nYour event page\n\n\n\nConvincing people to visit your event page is only half the battle. You'll also want them to purchase tickets, right? Creating an easy-to-navigate, beautiful event page helps showcase your event and get people excited about it! Even if you're not a computer whiz or a professional photographer, you can still create something for ticket sales that is more than just a transaction.\n\n\n\nSometimes images are better than words\n\n\n\nUse\u00a0hi-res photos\u00a0that give people an idea of what to expect at your event. We've found it looks best if the image does not contain any text, these images aren't a flier, they should be of people! People having fun, people learning, inside or outside -- whatever matches your event. By scanning one image for a second, people will know more about your event than reading paragraphs of text.\n\n\n\nHave a descriptive About Tab\n\n\n\nSince your images don't have any text, you're going to want to fill in that About Tab for your online ticket sales! This tab is where you describe your event and describe what people will get out of coming to your event. Make sure you clearly write all the practical details your event goers may need to know about the event like age and ticket restrictions, complicated building entry, if there's parking and whether there's food.\n\n\n\nConvey value in the ticket price\n\n\n\nIt can be tough figuring out how much to charge for a ticket, or to even charge at all. Everyone's event goal is different as far as making money or just breaking even, but one thing to keep in mind is the event goer has to see the value in purchasing your ticket. Too inexpensive ticket prices and people may not think the event isn't worth their time. Too expensive and people may think it's not worth their money. There is a sweet spot, though!\u200d\n\n\n\nGet out there and sell those tickets!\n\n\n\nAfter your event page is live, don't assume everyone knows about it. Keep on talking and advertising right up until your event starts (unless it sells out in advance, then good on you!) Remember that hashtag you created? Make sure you use it while posting during your event and make it known to event goers so they use it, too. This will create buzz during and after your event to encourage attendees to get excited for your next one!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/5a70db78a290250001f06d29_tixDollas1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

By learning how to promote an event on Facebook, you\u2019ll connect your events with tons of new, interested attendees in no time. Excited to learn more? We\u2019re here to show you the ropes of event promotion on Facebook to help you grow your events.\n\n\n\nHow to create an event on Facebook\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you\u2019ll need to build your Facebook event! To give you the most time to market your event, you should create a Facebook events page as soon as your event\u2019s main details are solidified (even if your event is more than a year out!). To help you with this, here are some best practices for building a strong event page.\n\n\n\n\nTitle:&nbsp;Clearly and uniquely state what your event is about in 64 characters or less (ideally under 40 characters for your Facebook ads later).\n\n\n\n\n\nCover photo:&nbsp;Display an eye-catching image that'll get viewers to stop scrolling, especially since it'll be their first impression of your Facebook event. This means use bright colors, add high-quality&nbsp;event photography, and get creative with your graphics!\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription:&nbsp;Once you've got the essentials covered like the date, time, and location, you'll want to highlight what your event has to offer, from special guests to fun activities to expected attendance numbers based on previous years. Consider linking off to your event's website too for more info.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd tickets:&nbsp;Include a link to your event's&nbsp;ticketing page&nbsp;to sell your tickets!&nbsp;TicketLeap&nbsp;makes this super easy, helping you set up an irresistible ticketing page in just minutes (we may be a little biased!).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion tab:&nbsp;Use this feed to update your viewers with new information about your guest lineup, exclusive discounts, parking details, etc. Encourage fans to ask their burning questions here, so you can easily respond to them!\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-hosts:&nbsp;Add any partners or featured sponsors as co-hosts to boost your event's credibility and so they can also invite tons of people to your event too!\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory:&nbsp;Under the \u201cMarket Your Event\u201d tab, include a relevant tag pertaining to the topic of your event (e.g., Sports, Foods, Comedy) and your location to help improve your&nbsp;event marketing SEO&nbsp;on Facebook, so when people search for events in your area, they'll find yours first!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:&nbsp;Facebook Event Page\n\n\n\nFree ways to start promoting your event\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve created your event, invite as many people as possible to get the ball rolling! You can invite up to 500 people yourself, and others can also invite 500 people. Be careful to send closer to 100-150 invites out at a given time though (and no more than 200 to be safe) to avoid Facebook accidentally marking your event as spam. You can also personally invite people through Facebook Messenger who follow your page and encourage them to invite friends!\n\n\n\nEncourage your co-hosts and sponsors to share your event with their audiences too, as well as tag them in relevant posts to open up your network and gain more impressions. You can also share your event in relevant Facebook groups so people with related interests can learn more about what you have to offer.\n\n\n\nCreate and share exciting content on your Facebook page to help build a buzz around your upcoming events. Leading up to event day, share highlights of your guest lineup, behind-the-scenes footage, exclusive discounts, and more to hype up your attendees. You can use your Instagram event content on Facebook as well to get more out of each post! Short-form videos (aka Reels) are especially powerful for expanding your event\u2019s reach to new audiences. And don\u2019t be afraid to repurpose content for your TikTok too!\n\n\n\nLooking for even more ways to promote events on your Facebook for free? Unlike Instagram, Facebook lets you share links on each of your posts \u2013 so take full advantage of it! Make sure your event\u2019s website and ticketing page are easily accessible in your bio and your posts. Plus, share the link to your Facebook event in your newsletter, on your website, across your other social media platforms, and on other channels in your event marketing strategy to cover all your bases!\n\n\n\nHow to boost an event on Facebook\n\n\n\nLook at you! You\u2019ve built a stellar Facebook event and started promoting it everywhere you can. Now, it\u2019s time to take your Facebook event marketing to the next level with paid ads. Let\u2019s walk through how to use the Facebook Boost Event feature to get your events in front of even more people!\n\n\n\n1. Build your Facebook event's ad\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve opted into boosting your event, the components of your Facebook event ad are similar, yet simplified, compared to those of your event page. Each ad includes three main components: an image, a description, and a call-to-action button. These follow similar best practices to creating a Facebook event page; however, you\u2019ll want to keep your description brief (Facebook recommends 3 lines at most). Ensure it covers only your most important information (e.g., age requirements, location) and encourages them to buy their tickets!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Facebook Event Ad\n\n\n\n2. Determine your target audience\n\n\n\nThis step wields the power to maximize your advertising budget and get your events in front of prospective attendees who may not have otherwise known about it. To do this, you can decide between these three types of audiences:\n\n\n\nA. New Audiences\n\n\n\nSelect specific characteristics to target such as location, demographics, or general interests. For an event, localized ads are the best place to start, so use broad interest-based targeting in the area surrounding your event (like music lovers in Owensboro, Kentucky for our concert example).\n\n\n\nB. Custom Audiences\n\n\n\nTarget people already interested in your event, from visiting your website, using your app, joining your email list, or engaging with your Facebook profile. This is great for remarketing purposes and for reminding loyal customers to share your upcoming event with their friends!\n\n\n\nC. Lookalike Audiences\n\n\n\nBuild new audiences for your ads modeled after your Custom Audiences. As a powerful example, you can put in an email list of last year\u2019s attendees, and Meta will create a lookalike audience of people with similar characteristics and interests.\n\n\n\nPro tip: start with as big of an audience as you can, then narrow it down based on who\u2019s converting the most (and turn off ads to the ones that don\u2019t).\n\n\n\n3. Allocate your ad spend\n\n\n\nHow much you plan to spend varies significantly depending on a ton of factors like your event category type, budget, venue size, ticket pricing, and what your desired outcome is. To allocate your budget, you can either set a campaign-wide spending limit with daily budgets for each of your given ads or just set a daily budget that runs continuously until you stop it. Since you generally have more control over your ad spend with a campaign-wide limit, we recommend using that to set a monthly budget, allocate that to the ads you\u2019ve created, then adjust from there.\n\n\n\n4. Set your campaign's duration\n\n\n\nSince successful Facebook ads are all about optimizing, you should set your campaign\u2019s duration as far in advance as possible. The more time you let your ads run, the more optimized your ads will become and the more efficient your ad spend will be. Launching your Facebook ads even a year or more out from your event day is ideal, though even a few months out could make a notable difference for your attendance numbers. Given enough time, you\u2019re sure to find your ads\u2019 sweet spot!\n\n\n\n5. Launch your Facebook event ads!\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set up all the elements of your Facebook ad and connected your desired payment method, review how your ad will look across mobile and desktop (and on Instagram if you opt into boosting your event there too). Once everything looks good, select \u201cBoost event now\u201d and you\u2019re ready to lift off!\n\n\n\n6. Monitor and optimize your ad campaign regularly\n\n\n\nCreating and launching your event ads is only half the battle; the rest is optimizing them. Once your Facebook ads are live, use the Breakdown feature at the top of your Meta Ads Manager dashboard to keep an eye on how they\u2019re performing and ensure your money is spent correctly. Check that your ads are reaching people in the right location (you don\u2019t want ads for an event in Florida to target people in Wisconsin!) and are actually converting to clicks (i.e., ticket sales!). From there, you can decide to boost your spending on the ads that are performing well, and pause the ones that aren\u2019t.\n\n\n\nCongrats! You\u2019ve successfully learned how to promote an event on Facebook! From posting fun event-related content and launching powerful ad campaigns, you\u2019ll be on track to gaining tons of new fans and selling more tickets with help from Facebook.

A well-written press release is more likely to be shared by journalists and other publications. That means you'll drive even more interest in your event and build brand awareness! Read on to learn how to write an effective press release and boost your promotional efforts today.\n\n\n\nWhat is a press release?\n\n\n\nA press release is considered your official event announcement and includes all the relevant, exciting details of your upcoming experience. This includes the five W's: when and where your event will take place, what it's all about, who will be there, and why you created it. Not only can a well-written press release be a super valuable tool to add to your\u00a0event marketing strategy, media personnel (usually your local newspapers and journalists) will be more likely to find your press release and may be inclined to share it!\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of an event press release?\n\n\n\nAn event press release is a proven, low-cost way to promote your upcoming experience, but the benefits don't stop there! Let's dive into a few reasons that you and your team should consider creating a press release for your event, shall we?\u200d\n\n\n\nIncrease brand awareness\n\n\n\nThis tool can be a formal way to build trust, better your organization's reputation, and create brand awareness with wider audiences. When a press release is shared, you'll gain immediate exposure to new readers (and potential customers). This has the added benefit of building trust between your local audience and your organization, as a credible news source publicly supporting you can really boost your reputation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrive event attendance\n\n\n\nThink about the number of people who are keeping up with trending news online. That's right, a ton! Writing a press release for your event gives you a chance to target attendees you may not be able to reach through typical marketing efforts like social media posts and email blasts. Creating a well-written press release will help generate even more buzz, ultimately\u00a0increasing ticket sales\u00a0and getting more excited customers into your event.\n\n\n\nSupport SEO efforts\n\n\n\nEvent press releases can also help your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. It gives you an opportunity to include targeted keywords relating to your event, making it more likely that potential customers will find it when they type in those words on search engines like Google and Bing. Plus, when other websites repost your press release and link back to yours, it shows Google and Bing that your content is valuable and should be ranked higher on their Search Engine Results Page.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow to write an effective event press release\n\n\n\nWriting a press release may seem daunting at first, but we'll help you through it! When drafting your announcement, include these seven key sections as a template:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate and location\n\n\n\nInclude the publication date of your press release and the location of your event (e.g., January 29, 2025 - Pittsburgh, PA) first. If you want your press release to be shared as soon as possible, then replace the date with \u201cfor immediate release.\u201d This is important because you don't want journalists to share the details of your event before you're ready! The actual date of your event will be shared later in the body of the press release.\n\n\n\nHeadline&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe key to a successful press release is a top-notch title or headline. You want to write something catchy that stops readers in their tracks and includes the name of your event. For example, if you're hosting a comedy fundraiser, your title could be \u201cThe Laugh of the Century at Sarah's Comedy Club Fundraiser.\u201d You can even further optimize for SEO by adding your most important keyword in the headline.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSubheading&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA subheading is an optional addition that expands on your headline. It should be one sentence and provide a quick overview of the main point of your press release and make readers want to learn more. For instance, a description like&nbsp;\u201cHelp us raise money to renovate Sarah's comedy club while listening to the best comedians in town,\u201d will get people invested.\n\n\n\nLead\n\n\n\nWrite a summary that gives the reader a brief overview of your event's story. Essentially, your lead is an introduction paragraph that answers the who, what, when, and why. Leave further details and explanations for the press release body.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPro tip: We recommend writing your lead after you've completed the rest of the press release sections!\u200d\n\n\n\nBody&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYou'll be spending most of your time writing the body of your press release, as you'll now dive into what's in store for attendees. Are there any celebrities, popular vendors, guest speakers, or raffles? Spill the details! Provide the most newsworthy information up front and end with the more granular information. Be sure to really communicate the value people will receive from attending your event.\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\n\n\nInclude any testimonials about your event throughout the body copy of your press release. Whether straight from the event organizer or special guests, this is the time to talk yourself up! Plus, including what past event-goers have said about their experience at your event helps give credibility to what you're promising to deliver.\n\n\n\nCompany information\n\n\n\nTo end your press release, include the details of your company and what you do. If you already have a prepared elevator pitch, this is the place to add it. You should also include media contact information (contact name, phone number, and email address) for anyone who wants to follow up with you. You can include the details of any special guests or keynote speakers you discussed in the press release as well. They'll love the additional publicity!\n\n\n\nUsing these guidelines to write your event press release will make it easier than ever, and you'll be sure to\u00a0drive more ticket sales\u00a0to your event!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6390c27fdb663d2f0130b614_PressReleaseBlogImageJazzMusicians-scaled-1-1024x702.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Well, there's no need to worry. There are plenty of ways to boost event registrations without spending any money, and with an easy-to-use event registration software, you won't have to spend much time, either.\n\n\n\n1. Alert your existing audience and reward their loyalty\n\n\n\nThe people most likely to register for your next event are people who are already fans of your organization. Your email list will really come in handy here \u2013 send an email and let them know about your upcoming event. If you've held an event before, this is your chance to get some repeat customers by remarketing your events to past attendees. Send out an email campaign and include a loyalty code to encourage them to buy tickets using a discount code or use a \"Buy One, Get One Free\" offer\n\n\n\nIf you don't already have a huge email list, get the message out to your audience on social media. As your audience grows, it's a good idea to keep track of how many people have opened your email marketing blast. A dedicated email tool can give you stats on how many people looked at your event email, how many clicked a link to go through to your event registration page, and how many people haven't even had a chance to open it yet.\n\n\n\n2. Make event registration a breeze\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of things that make potential buyers hesitate to register for an event, so you want to eliminate as many obstacles as possible from the purchasing and registration process (This is where event registration software comes in). Put yourself in the shoes of your event attendees \u2013 you want to do as little typing and clicking as possible to get registered. If there is too much navigating between event pages or your event registration form is too long, potential ticket buyers might leave the transaction.\n\n\n\nA good event registration platform is the tool you need for a frictionless experience for event attendees, from a custom event registration page that looks great and draws in potential attendees, to a streamlined checkout process that is simple to do on any device. And, since event registration software includes a secure way to accept credit card payments, your attendees can feel safe sharing their payment information.\n\n\n\n3. Promote an A-list guest\n\n\n\nDoes your conference have a standout speaker? Is a superstar chef of a local 4-star restaurant doing a cooking demo at your community center? Let people know! A well-known name can generate major buzz, so post some teasers on social media, send an event email before registration begins, and make the big announcement when your event goes live. Your headline speakers will have their own established audiences you can tap into for ticket buyers. Don't forget to tag your special guest so they can easily share your promotional posts with their followers!\n\n\n\n4. Get creative with your event registration options\n\n\n\nEvent registration software allows you to create different ticket types for prospective attendees to register for your event. Creating a tiered ticket pricing system with your event software gives people different options for buying, but you don't want to create too many options and overwhelm them.\n\n\n\nStarting your ticket campaign with early bird discount tickets is great for driving registrations soon after your event goes live. With VIP tickets, you can add value and give your attendees perks when they register, like special seating, early admission, or meet and greet access. Bundled tickets are an opportunity to upsell \u2013 include registration plus merchandise or a meal at your event in a single ticket price. Or create a custom option that suits your unique needs. When it comes to ticket types, the only limit is your imagination.\n\n\n\n5. Create a contest or giveaway on social media\n\n\n\nSocial media giveaways are a virtually free way to get the word out about your event and increase registration. The best platform for your contest is usually the one where you already have the biggest following, but can also help grow your audience. Contests on your social media channels almost always get great engagement, and that can have a positive effect on how much your posts show up in the organic algorithms, meaning you'll get more eyes on your content without spending a dime.\n\n\n\nAn Instagram comment contest where users have to tag their friends boosts engagement for your organization and promotes your event to a totally new audience (don't forget to post a link to your event landing page in your bio). You can also direct your users from one platform to another (Post a link to your Instagram contest) or hold a different giveaway for each platform (have your followers post using your event's custom hashtag or share your event link on Facebook). For only the price of admission, social media giveaways can have big returns when it comes to increasing registrations.\n\n\n\n6. Find an event sponsor or partnership\n\n\n\nFind sponsors for your event by reaching out to businesses or industry organizations related to your event. A thoughtful partnership with a sponsor that matches the values and interests of your organization and audience can do a lot to increase event registrations. Look for businesses that would be interested in connecting with the target audience that you're bringing to your event to make sure they receive as much benefit from the partnership and successful event as you would.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if you're running an event about home improvement, pitch a sponsorship to a local hardware store or paint store. Cross-promotion builds awareness when your sponsor promotes your event to their audience, typically in exchange for brand visibility at your event. Cash sponsorships and donations of products or services increase the value of your event, which means that you can charge more for registration and your attendees will still feel like they are getting a lot for their money.\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/61f857b986c05c2960297a82_pexels-josh-sorenson-976866-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":51,"name":"Event Registration","slug":"event-registration","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":51,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Our ticketing platform makes it easy for attendees to register for your next event.

Similar to your other marketing efforts, you'll need to figure out your target audience (your event's niche on Instagram) and create social media content that both resonates with them and helps you reach your goals \u2013 like selling more tickets!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow should I build my event promotion strategy for Instagram?\n\n\n\nBefore we get to creating posts, it's important to have a strategy behind your Instagram event promotion. For one, you'll want to set goals for yourself, including how much you want to grow your account and how many tickets you'll want to sell from your efforts. Then, you'll need to determine what resources you have available. Will you be managing your event's Instagram account yourself, or will you have additional staff members helping you? In addition to creating content, is there any room in your event budget for advertising? For editing your video content, will you edit them within Instagram itself or use a third-party app like CapCut, iMovie, or even Adobe Premiere Pro?\n\n\n\nThe key to growing your Instagram account is consistency. To help with this, try dedicating time in your week to film, edit, and schedule your event Instagram posts. You could also create a content calendar to map out what kinds of posts you'll do and when. This is particularly important in building a buzz around your event's lineup announcements, exclusive ticket discounts, giveaways, and other exciting developments leading up to the big day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat types of Instagram content should I make?\n\n\n\nAs an event promoter, you have a wide range of content types to choose from, each connecting with your event's audience in different ways. That's the beauty of Instagram! By understanding what works best for each type of Instagram event post, you're sure to grow your following and sell more tickets! To help with that, here's a full breakdown of the four main types:\n\n\n\n1. Reels\n\n\n\nExposure level: The majority of viewers are non-followers, and this appears in your followers' feeds as well.\n\n\n\nAbout: Reels are short-form videos (between 15-90 seconds in length) that appear in the dedicated Reels tab, main Instagram feed, and Explore tab. Since the dawn of TikTok, these shorter videos continue to trend and are the key to gaining lots of exposure in front of new audiences. In fact, 85% of viewers prefer videos under 15 seconds, and these short-form videos get between 2-3 times higher engagement than long-form videos. According to Instagram, Reels make up over 50% of the content reshared and is the platform's fastest growing content type, making them the most likely to go viral of your event Instagram posts.\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nGrab viewers' attention in the first three seconds (i.e., \u201cthe hook\u201d).\n\n\n\nUse trending audio clips that encourage viewers to click the audio tab and make a Reel of their own.\n\n\n\nIncorporate quick transitions, effects, and text throughout your video (especially at key scenes) so people watch your whole video.\n\n\n\nCheck out the Inspiration tab in your account's Professional Dashboard for content ideas related to your page and that are most popular with your followers.\n\n\n\nInclude 3-5 hashtags on your post, using a mix of general terms and specific hashtags to your event niche.\n\n\n\nAdd your location to help people in your area discover your Reels more easily.\n\n\n\nInclude a question or call-to-action (like \u201cTag friends in the comments!\u201d) in your post's caption to help drive engagement.\n\n\n\n\n(Bonus!) A few ideas for you:\n\n\n\n\nAsk funny questions to your event attendees.\n\n\n\nFind a trend or challenge and take your own twist on it.\n\n\n\nDo a fun dance or challenge with your event staff.\n\n\n\nFilm a highlight reel from your event day.\n\n\n\nCapture behind-the-scenes clips of your event.\n\n\n\nDo a time-lapse or before &amp; after of your event setup.\n\n\n\nShare tips &amp; tricks in your event's niche (e.g., if you own a farm, show people seasonal recipes or gardening tips).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Posts\n\n\n\nExposure level: The majority of viewers are your followers, although non-followers may discover this in the Explore tab.\n\n\n\nAbout: Social media posts are a collection of between 1-20 photos and videos you can share at a given time in Instagram's feed and on the Explore page. Unlike Reels, you can post longer videos (up to 60 minutes). While Reels are focused on giving you maximum exposure, posts are where you can engage more with your followers. They're the perfect place to show off those event photography skills to Instagram users! Shine the spotlight on your events by posting content like crowd shots from previous events, and announcements of your lineup to get attendees excited!\n\n\n\nBest practices:\u200d\n\n\n\n\nKeep the colors and filters of your posts consistent with your event's branding, and take advantage of natural lighting whenever possible for high-quality photos.\n\n\n\nIf you're posting multiple pieces of content, make sure your most eye-catching one is first and, according to Instagram, it's best if you post a mixture of photos and videos.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdd your location and\/or a calendar reminder of your next event date to relevant posts.\n\n\n\nTag relevant sponsors, featured guests, partners, or other people featured in your event Instagram posts.\n\n\n\nAdd 3-5 hashtags related to your post's topic and event niche.\n\n\n\nWrite a short, compelling caption that encourages your followers to answer a question or take action (like \u201cBuy your tickets,\u201d \u201cShop now,\u201d or \u201cTag a friend\u201d).\n\n\n\nTurn on \u201cUpload at highest quality\u201d in your Instagram account settings for the best quality photos on your posts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Stories\n\n\n\nExposure level: Most viewers are your followers, while occasionally non-followers may click into your account's story after discovering one of your Reels or posts.\n\n\n\nAbout: Instagram Stories are photos or short video clips that are only displayed for 24 hours, appearing at the top of your feed or whenever someone clicks your account's profile icon. For all the post types, stories are the most up close and personal way for your followers to get to know you and your events. As just a few ideas, you could create stories that are snapshots of your day as an event organizer, reshare others' posts of your event, or launch a fun poll to engage users.\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nPost at least one story a day. It's a super quick way to stay top of mind with your followers, plus these can be anything!\n\n\n\nHighlight at least 3-5 collections of Instagram Stories to showcase on your profile.\n\n\n\nInclude interactive elements like polls, emoji sliders, and Q&amp;As that encourage your followers to engage with your story.\n\n\n\nAdd links that encourage your viewers to visit your website or event listing to buy their tickets. (Besides the link in your bio, stories is the only place you can share clickable links, so take full advantage of it!)\n\n\n\nMention other accounts in your Instagram Stories (like @ticketleap!). They'll likely share your shoutout on their story with their followers too!\n\n\n\nShare others' posts that are relevant to your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Instagram Live\n\n\n\nExposure level: Primarily just your followers (not easily discoverable to non-followers)\n\n\n\nAbout: Instagram Live is their live-streaming platform that appears at the top of your feed in front of Instagram Stories. This feature can help your event stand out to your followers and strengthen your connections with them. You can also repurpose your Live content by posting it later. Live is particularly great for Q&amp;A sessions with your featured guests and event staff or quick snippets of your event in action (for a little FOMO!).\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nAnnounce beforehand when you'll be going live (on your story or in a post) to hype your followers up before it happens!\n\n\n\nCreate a consistent live-streaming schedule, so your audience can expect when you\u2019ll be live and keep coming back for more each week.\n\n\n\nTake advantage of Practice mode to check your internet connection and do a test run before you actually go live.\n\n\n\nAdd an eye-catching title to your Instagram Live.\n\n\n\nGreet people by name as they enter your live-stream to make it more personal to them and encourage them to stick around.\n\n\n\nFor fun collaborations with others, use Live Rooms to invite up to three other accounts (like a keynote speaker or performer at your events) to join your Live.\n\n\n\nEncourage people to leave questions in the chat for you to answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Channels\n\n\n\nExposure level: Your followers only\n\n\n\nAbout: Broadcast channels are a powerful way to deepen connections with your followers and turn them into loyal fans! You'll be able to send messages, like event reminders or important updates, directly to your followers' inboxes. Unlike on social media posts, you can include links in your messages.\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n\n\n\nLaunch polls and create prompts to get direct feedback as well as start conversations around specific event topics.\n\n\n\nShare important links (like to your ticketing page!) to drive event registration, ticket sales, and website traffic.\n\n\n\nPromote your broadcast channel through your Instagram Stories and on your live-streams to get more people to join\n\n\n\nCustomize your channel's background to fit your brand and create a compelling space for your community.\n\n\n\nGive your channel a fun name! People can see your channel name when they first land on your profile, so give it a name that makes them want to click.\n\n\n\nSend occasional voice messages from you and your staff to promote an event and genuinely thank your followers for their support. Your community will appreciate this authentic touch!\n\n\n\nSend at least 3 messages a week to boost engagement to your broadcast channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should my event hashtag strategy look like?\n\n\n\nBuilding an effective event hashtag strategy for Instagram is key to leveling up your posts by optimizing them for SEO to relevant search terms. Start with testing different variations using between 1-10 hashtags. Hint: 3-5 hashtags is usually the sweet spot for optimal visibility. Keep your event hashtag short, punchy, and aligned with your event's content. It\u2019s also vital to consider the popularity of each hashtag; a balanced mix is key. Include hashtags with 10K+, 50K+, 100K+, and even 1M+ posts to reach both niche and broader audiences. Incorporating a variety of event-specific hashtags (#PrimaFest) and general ones (like #LiveMusic) can help you gain targeted reach while also building community buzz. And don\u2019t forget to tap into the power of AI event planning tools like ChatGPT to spark creative hashtag ideas for your posts!\n\n\n\nHow can I use Instagram Shop to drive more sales?\n\n\n\nWith 70% of users making purchases from shoppable posts and 50% more likely to buy directly from Instagram, the Instagram Shop feature is a powerhouse for creating an additional revenue stream and expanding your event business. By turning your profile into a digital storefront, you can sell products like your event's merchandise, homemade products, or other branded items while also promoting your ticket sales. For example, a university could offer an easy way for fans of their sports team to buy gear or for students to shop for their favorite campus merch.\n\n\n\nThink of Instagram Shop as an extension of your website, interacting with your community every single day. You can directly link featured products to your posts, making it easier than ever for people to buy what they see and love. Plus, your Instagram page provides a holistic view of your brand so your customers can really get to know who they're buying from. To set up your shop, you\u2019ll need to own your domain URL, have a free professional business account on Instagram, and then build out your catalog of products. An important note: you can't sell things from a third-party site (like your tickets) through Instagram Shop, but you can still promote those links in your bio, on stories, and in your broadcast channel! With Instagram Shop, you\u2019ll have a powerful, integrated sales channel that streamlines the shopping experience for your audience and increases your revenue potential!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I use Instagram ads?\n\n\n\nInstagram ads are a powerful tool for promoting events! This is ideal for event marketing campaign goals like driving ticket sale revenue and selling merchandise. As an event organizer, your Instagram ad goals should be to drive people to your event page to sell more tickets and to earn at least $5 for every $1 spent in ads. If you use ads to just boost the view count on your posts, it\u2019s not as effective in giving you a return on your investment.\n\n\n\nPhoto and video are the two types of Instagram event ads you can create. While it's good to do a mix of both, we recommend focusing on video ads, since they tend to capture your audience's attention more than photos. In fact, it's so powerful that revenue from short-form video ads is expected to surpass $10 billion over this past year! Plus, with seamless integration into the Meta Ads Manager, you can efficiently launch event ads on both Instagram and Facebook, amplifying your event's reach with ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs influencer marketing on Instagram right for my events?\n\n\n\nInfluencer marketing on Instagram can be a game-changer for promoting your events, especially if you partner with micro-influencers (between 10K to 100K followers) and nano-influencers (between 1,000 to 10K followers). These avid content creators often have highly engaged and loyal audiences, making their recommendation of your events more authentic and impactful. To make influencer marketing work for your event, recruit influencers in your niche to create buzz-worthy content like event previews, host giveaways for free tickets or VIP perks, or share behind-the-scenes footage to build excitement leading up to the big day. Plus, influencers with a smaller, dedicated following are not only effective but also a budget-friendly way to expand your event's reach!\n\n\n\nDon't forget that your event attendees are influencers of your brand too! As a key to your event's success, they're the ones who invite friends and family to join them at your unforgettable experiences year after year. Encourage them to take photos and create short videos, then tag you on Instagram in their posts and use your branded event hashtag. This user-generated content is not only free promotion for your event, but it also has a genuine way of resonating with potential attendees!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext level tips for growing on Instagram for an upcoming event\n\n\n\nWith your content strategy solidified, there's some extra things you can do to help set your Instagram up for success! One of the biggest tips is to engage with other accounts. According to Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri, Instagram's algorithms tend to favor accounts that more frequently interact with their followers and push their content more. So, don't be shy when liking, commenting, sharing, and messaging other accounts!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo help level up your content, see what's performing the best for other accounts in your Instagram event niche and let that give you ideas for your posts too. Encourage your attendees, guests, and staff to tag you in anything they post about your events. This is an extremely powerful way to get your event in front of new audiences and hopefully gain more followers.\n\n\n\nYou'll also want to keep your account's bio updated often and use the link in your bio to direct people to your event ticketing page, your website, or a third-party service like Linktree that lets you post multiple links at once. Your ultimate goal is to convert your Instagram followers into excited event-goers, so you'll want to make it as easy as possible to buy their tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecome a master of Instagram event promotion\n\n\n\nNow that you know how to promote an event on Instagram, it's time to get creative with your posts. And remember, don't overthink it! Social media is an art, not a science. Have fun making content that showcases your events and experimenting until you find what works best for you. The key is to stay consistent with it.\n\n\n\n\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/instagram-on-mobile-device-1024x591.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Of all the event marketing strategies out there, search engine optimization (SEO) is one of the most powerful ways to connect to customers without cutting into your budget. Sounds great, but wondering how to get started? We've put together this complete guide on SEO for event planners to help you do just that!\n\n\n\nBut first, what is SEO?\n\n\n\nSearch engine optimization (aka SEO) is the process of improving your website so that it appears higher in search results, increasing your event's visibility. At any given moment, someone may search Google for upcoming events in your area that interest them. Your goal? Put your event at the top of those search results! This is an essential part of your&nbsp;event marketing strategy&nbsp;because you'll get more people to visit your site, interact with your content, and ultimately buy tickets to your awesome events.\n\n\n\nIt's also important to note that SEO helps your site appear organically in search results. This means your site will naturally generate as a search result, as opposed to using paid search to appear at the top of that page with the word \u201cAd\u201d next to your site.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, let's dive into the practical tips of our SEO guide for event marketing!\n\n\n\n1. Define your target audience\n\n\n\nFirst things first, you'll need to determine who you're writing this page for. Depending on who your target audience is, your content should speak directly to what's important to them and match what they're searching for. This specifically means that the keywords you use will likely vary based on your audience and their search intent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, if you're hosting a workshop or class, you may use more professional and industry-related terms. If you're hosting a community-wide event, you'll probably stick to casual, everyday words and phrases. You'll also want to use local terms that people will search for related to your event's location, such as the city, venue name, and region.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Boost your visibility on Google search results\n\n\n\nWhen people search Google for something, the page that appears is called the SERP, which is short for \u201csearch engine results page.\u201d On this SERP are websites Google thinks are relevant to you, displaying the title of each page and a brief description (called the \"meta description\"). The higher your page is on these search results, the more likely a person will click on it. Here are a few ways to help boost your page's performance on this SERP:\n\n\n\nConduct keyword research\n\n\n\nKeywords are the search terms that you want your website to appear for. If you're hosting a pumpkin patch, for example, some relevant keywords might include \u201cpumpkin patch near me,\u201d \u201cpumpkin picking,\u201d or \u201cbest fall events.\u201d Keyword research tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Google Keyword Planner can help you determine what these search terms are for your event. You can also visit your competitors' sites to see what keywords they appear for on Google.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs you do so, you'll also need to consider a person's search intent. Google might relate certain general phrases to more topics than you might expect. For example, if someone searches \u201ctheater events\" looking for musicals or play performances, the SERP might also display movie theater times too. To avoid this, focus on keywords as specific to your event's niche as possible that still have substantial search volume. Pull a list of the best keywords together, so you can include them throughout your website. By matching both the keywords and their search intent, you'll improve your rankings on relevant SERPs and draw in visitors of your ideal audience!\n\n\n\nPerfect your site's title tags and meta descriptions\n\n\n\nYour title tag and meta description are the first thing that users will see when your website appears in their search results \u2013 so make it count! To give you an idea of what we're talking about, here's an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo grab viewers' attention, your title tag (the larger blue text) should be around 60 characters long, incorporate your event's name at the beginning, and have your most important keyword in it somewhere too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust beneath that is a brief summary called the meta description. This should be between 70 to 160 characters long, describe what your event offers, and give potential ticket buyers a call-to-action (CTA) that persuades them to click. Within it, be sure to include at least 1-2 relevant keywords from your previous research above. This last piece is especially important because it directly impacts your click-through rate (CTR), which is the number of people who click on your link out of the total number of people who view it. The higher your CTR is, the better your chance of getting listed higher on the SERP!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Put relevant event details front and center\n\n\n\nOnce you've drawn people into your website, display your event's most important information at the top of the page, including the name, date(s), time(s), and location. Pairing this with an eye-catching photo or video can help draw readers in too (more on this later!). Then, the rest of your page should give the inside scoop on your event. That way, your readers will have everything they need to know for the big day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon't forget to incorporate similar target keywords throughout your copy (similar to the ones in your title tag and meta description) to reinforce the relevancy of your content to Google. Consider adding an FAQ section, your contact info, and social media handles as well.\n\n\n\n4. Make your CTA loud and clear\n\n\n\nBecause your site visitors can click away at any second and your end goal is to sell more tickets, you'll want your CTA button as clear as possible. The easier you make it to buy tickets, the more likely you are to sell more of them! So, add it near the top of the page, use bold colors and font, and insert short but compelling copy to make it stand out. As for the CTA link itself, use a platform like TicketLeap to build an\u00a0irresistible landing page!\n\n\n\n5. Add high-quality links to your event page\n\n\n\nBacklinking is an effective way to build your site's credibility. This means whenever another site links off to your pages, you earn a \u201cbacklink\u201d from them. If you return the favor, then they'll earn backlinks from you too. People may share a link to your website from their social media pages, blogs, news articles, or other reputable sites. Please note, these sources need to be credible. This is because the quality of your backlinks will either help or hurt how search engines think of your site as well.\n\n\n\nTo help with this, don't be afraid to ask people (e.g., your&nbsp;sponsors, performers, and affiliates) to link to your site. Backlinking lets search engines know your site has a great reputation and will, in turn, be more likely to rank your site. Having other websites talk about yours also increases web traffic and introduces your event to more people!\n\n\n\n6. Make the most of your images and videos\n\n\n\nDid you know the images on your site can help you in two different ways? On one hand, using high-quality images and videos from your&nbsp;event photography efforts&nbsp;can help hook new fans in. Using images of attendees having the time of their lives at your past events can make your next event seem irresistible to website visitors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, you can also make your site more accessible by inserting alternative text (alt text) that briefly describes what your images are. This text will appear if your image doesn't load, and it's especially helpful for those who are visually impaired or rely on screen readers. As a search engine crawls your website and decides its search ranking, this provides extra signals regarding how your content ties to relevant search results.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n7. Incorporate structured data\n\n\n\nStructured data, or schema, are snippets of code added to your webpage that tell search engines more about your website. Adding these extra details to your site can help you rank higher on a given SERP. By providing&nbsp;structured data about your event&nbsp;(e.g., date, time, location, and&nbsp;ticket prices), search engines can more easily read your site and display additional search enhancements under your main website, like links to subpages or a map of your event's location. Luckily, with a ticketing platform like TicketLeap, we do this automatically for you on your event listing. As for your actual website, you'll likely want to consult your specific provider on how to include this.\n\n\n\n8. Ensure your site is mobile friendly\n\n\n\nThe majority of website visitors nowadays use their mobile devices, so optimizing your site for mobile is a must. Build your layout so it works as seamlessly on someone's phone as it does on their desktop. Plus, regarding SEO event best practices, Google heavily prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in its ranking system, meaning your freshly optimized site will have a better chance to rank higher!\n\n\n\n9. Track your success!\n\n\n\nMeasure your site's performance to help you determine how you can make it even better! Use Google Analytics, Google Search Console, or other tools to track your performance and conversion rate based on your visitor count. You can also see where people are coming in from to measure the effectiveness of your&nbsp;event marketing&nbsp;campaigns and to see what types of searches your website is appearing for.\n\n\n\nNow that you've made it through our guide on SEO for events, it's time to put it into practice! And remember, there's always room for improvement. Then, once you've got your website tailored for SEO, you'll have an extra leg up on your competition when promoting and&nbsp;selling your tickets!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/649db9537b079bd53b24ca10_packed-concert-with-confetti-scaled-1-1024x572.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

If you scored tickets to a sporting event, concert, or anything in between and can't make it, you might be able to make your money back \u2013 or even sell them for a profit! Learn the basics of ticket resale and how to keep your wallet happy by reselling your event tickets.\n\n\n\nIf you bought tickets to an upcoming concert, festival, or other event and can no longer attend, you might be wondering how to resell them. Or maybe you're a season ticket holder for your favorite sports team but don't plan on attending every game. Whether your event tickets were bought months in advance or the day before, online ticket resellers can help you put your unwanted tickets to good use, and \u2013 if you're lucky \u2013 even turn a profit.\n\n\n\nBefore we dive in, let's review what ticket resale is and how it differs from ticket brokering and scalping.\n\n\n\nWhat is ticket resale?\n\n\n\nTicket resale&nbsp;essentially means that you're reselling a ticket of admission to an event. The tickets are bought from a licensed seller and then sold by the owner of the tickets for whatever price they choose.\n\n\n\nTicket brokering&nbsp;is a type of ticket resale where you buy event tickets in bulk from a licensed seller and then resell them at a higher price. Because most reselling happens online, ticket brokering can sometimes be confused with ticket scalping, but they're very different!\n\n\n\nWhat is ticket scalping?\n\n\n\nTicket scalping&nbsp;is similar to brokering because tickets are bought in bulk, but that's where the similarities end. Scalpers use unfair methods to automate their bulk ticket buying. Specifically, they use bots to make purchases faster than typical customers can. The tickets are then resold at a significantly inflated price, meaning that many excited customers who otherwise would have bought a ticket may not be able to anymore. Not only can this affect the reputation of an event that tickets are being scalped for, but it can also lead to lower attendance rates (and we know you want a packed house!)\n\n\n\nIs ticket scalping illegal?\n\n\n\nAlthough there are no federal laws against ticket scalping, 15 states have banned it in some way. In some of those states, if you're caught scalping, you can be fined and\/or spend up to a year in jail.\n\n\n\nHow ticketing platforms prevent scalping\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of ways that ticketing platforms help event organizers battle unwanted scalpers, and we recommend implementing one or all of these if you're&nbsp;selling tickets online to your own event:\n\n\n\n\nPut a limit on the maximum number of tickets one person can buy\n\n\n\nUse CAPTCHAs so ticket buyers must prove they're human and not a scalper bot\n\n\n\nRequire customers to make an account on your website before purchasing\n\n\n\n\nWhen choosing&nbsp;the right ticketing platform&nbsp;for your event, be sure to ask about their strategies for combating scalpers!\n\n\n\nHow to resell tickets\n\n\n\nNow that we know some basic terms, let's figure out how to resell your extra event tickets so everyone comes out as a winner. First, you'll want to determine your online ticket marketplace options. You may already know some of the most popular places you can resell tickets, like Ticketmaster, StubHub, and SeatGeek, but how do you know which reseller is best for you? Well, the answer depends on the unique aspects of your event, like the type of tickets you're selling, your audience base, fees and payment methods, and much more. But fear not: we're here to guide you through it!\n\n\n\nReselling tickets to concerts and sporting events\n\n\n\nIf you're looking to resell tickets for an in-demand concert, festival, or sporting event, Ticketmaster and StubHub should be the first on your list. These marketplaces are super secure and well known, so you'll have the best chance to sell your tickets&nbsp;at a good price. In some cases, these larger platforms also allow you to sell your parking pass to the buyer, too!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you're trying to sell tickets for smaller events, like a college football game, give ticket resellers like TicketNetwork and Vivid Seats a try. With all of these options, not only can you sell your event tickets with ease, but you can also skip negotiating directly with the ticket buyer entirely!\n\n\n\nSafe and secure ticket resellers\n\n\n\nHere at TicketLeap, we want customers around the world to always have an easy ticket purchase process, fast admission into every event, and an unforgettable experience while they're there. That can't happen if there are\u00a0fake tickets\u00a0floating around! That's why you should always buy and sell tickets on reputable platforms, as most will only resell tickets that are purchased from official, licensed ticket sources.\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlus, many of the largest ticket reseller platforms give ticket buyers a \u201cvalid ticket or your money back\u201d guarantee. And if you accidentally sell a fake ticket on one of these sites? You may be liable for charges up to double the amount of the ticket sale price, so always carefully read your ticketing resale marketplace's terms and conditions to make sure you're following all of their rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket reseller fees and payment methods\n\n\n\nIf you're thinking about reselling your event tickets, you're probably hoping to make your money back or even gain a profit. To make sure you're not leaving money on the table, pay close attention to a ticket reseller's fees and payment methods.\n\n\n\nFor example, how will you get paid? Most platforms have a variety of ways to get your money, including through bank transfers, PayPal, or a check. When will you get paid? It often depends on payment type, but your ticket reseller should have detailed information for you. Lastly (and most importantly), what fees are associated with your ticket resale? Generally, the lower the fee, the more money in your pocket. Fees for the ticket reseller could be as low as 0% or all the way up to 15%, so keep that in mind while you crunch the numbers!\n\n\n\nTicket resale FAQs\n\n\n\nCan I list resale tickets on multiple ticketing marketplaces?\n\n\n\nYou&nbsp;can&nbsp;list event tickets on multiple online ticket resale platforms, but you're responsible for fulfilling the ticket sale on each. This is not recommended because there is a risk that you could double-sell your tickets, which would mean you'd be unable to fulfill one of those sales. That could end up costing you double the ticket price or more!\n\n\n\nWhere is the best place to resell tickets?\n\n\n\nThe best place to resell your official event tickets is with a reputable, online ticket reseller marketplace. Make sure you read their ticket seller's terms and conditions and follow all of their rules so you don't lose out on any money.\n\n\n\nIs ticket scalping illegal?\n\n\n\nIt depends on which state you're in. While there are no federal laws against ticket scalping, 15 states have banned the practice in some way.\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/620534007bd53db545a5d91f_ticket-resell-hero-1024x683.jpg","category_obj":[{"term_id":52,"name":"Sell Event Tickets","slug":"sell-event-tickets","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":52,"taxonomy":"category","description":"As event organizers everywhere, selling tickets is one of the key components of hosting successful events.

If you're itching to take your events to the next level, posting on TikTok might just be your golden ticket. Whether it's adding your own flair to the latest trends or teaming up with fellow creators, this guide is sure to help your events shine even brighter as they cross users' For You page. Ready to learn more? Let's explore the art of leveraging this powerful social media platform, and kickstart your event promotion on TikTok!\n\n\n\nStrategizing your TikTok event content\n\n\n\nTo get the most out of your TikTok event marketing, you'll want to do a bit of planning first. Depending on what your awesome event is, first you'll need to figure out your TikTok event niche, whether that be festivals, pop-up experiences, haunted houses, or something else. Then, take some time to explore and engage videos from other TikTok creators in that niche. As you do so, note any ideas you come across that you may want to try yourself! You should also jot down any popular hashtags in your niche's posts \u2013 these'll be great additions to your captions later.\n\n\n\nFleshing out your content goals and plan\n\n\n\nAs with any successful&nbsp;event marketing&nbsp;endeavor, you'll want to set some content goals upfront. Are you trying to drive more awareness to your organization as a whole? Or perhaps you're focused on&nbsp;boosting ticket sales&nbsp;for a specific event that's on the calendar? Pinpoint important dates you'll want to draw attention to with your TikToks, such as when you'll unveil your guest lineup, when tickets go on sale, and of course, the big event day. You can also plan the types of videos you'll capture during your events to build FOMO (fear of missing out) for future content.\n\n\n\nTo grow the most on TikTok, consistency is key. To help you with this and to keep track of your target post dates, put together a content calendar to help you schedule when you'll create and post your videos. This'll help you figure out the best times each week to post too. Need some extra hands? Consider inviting some of your&nbsp;event staff&nbsp;in on the fun to help you with your social media!\n\n\n\nHow to create viral-worthy TikTok event content\n\n\n\nTime to get creative and jumpstart your event marketing on TikTok! From the moment you first start filming to when you hit post, we'll show you some key ingredients to setting your posts up for success:\n\n\n\n1. Film high-quality videos\n\n\n\nThe beauty of TikTok is you simply need a phone camera to get started. No fancy equipment required \u2013 unless you want to! That said, make sure to always film your videos vertically and consider using a tripod or asking a friend to help film for you. Similar to capturing high-quality&nbsp;event photography, be mindful of your lighting and use natural light to your advantage as much as possible, ensuring your TikToks always look great. Pro tip: for iPhone users, you can auto-lock your focus and exposure for maximum control of the lighting in your videos.\n\n\n\n2. Hook your viewers\n\n\n\nYou only have between 1-4 seconds to grab your viewers' attention before they keep scrolling, so the hook at the beginning of your video is essential to drawing people in and making them want to watch to the end. This could be a simple yet clever line of text, a voiceover, or an eye-catching video transition (just to name a few). If you're giving advice, mention a numbered list so people watch to hear all the items on your list. Need more ideas? See what other creators are doing in the first three seconds of their videos and draw inspiration from them.\n\n\n\n3. Make engaging content\n\n\n\nWhat helps TikTok push your videos to more people? Having people watch your videos to the end (if not multiple times!) and engaging with your content by liking, commenting, and sharing. To help keep viewers' attention the whole time, your TikToks should ideally be between&nbsp;15-30 seconds&nbsp;long, and no more than 60 seconds. Include quick transitions, effects, and text throughout your videos to keep things interesting. The key is to just be yourself! People will resonate most with your TikTok event content if it's genuine. So, find what works for you and what your audience seems most engaged with, then create more content in that vein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Try some trends\n\n\n\nKeep an eye out for trends, challenges, or memes that you can be a part of! As you scroll through your For You page, save viral videos and trending sounds to use in your own videos. When you film your TikToks, you can also explore trending effects and songs to incorporate as well. Try using hilarious sound bites over your TikTok with a funny caption over the top of it, or create Stitches and Duets with popular videos. TikTok is all about experimenting and trying stuff out, so don't be afraid to put your own twist on popular trends!\n\n\n\n5. Master your captions\n\n\n\nYour TikTok caption serves two purposes. One, it'll help hook viewers into your video, so use emojis, witty phrases, or questions to keep the conversation going in the comments. Two, the text in your caption makes it easier for people to find your videos when they search for related keywords. This is because TikTok has become more of a search engine for content, considering millions of TikToks are posted every day. Therefore, include keywords in your caption and in your TikTok's cover image too. You'll also want to use a geolocation tag to target people in your event's area, and tag any relevant accounts in your TikToks, like your&nbsp;event sponsors!\n\n\n\nBonus tip: Rather than manually post your videos, you're now able to upload and&nbsp;schedule your TikToks&nbsp;on your desktop!\n\n\n\nUtilizing TikTok paid ads\n\n\n\nWant to kick your TikTok event marketing up a notch? In addition to posting organic content, you can launch paid TikTok ads after creating a business account. By doing so, you'll be able to better target viewers in your event's niche and&nbsp;boost your ticket sales. A particularly powerful tool that TikTok has is its&nbsp;Creator Marketplace. This allows you to partner with TikTok influencers who already have an established fanbase of over 10,000 followers who can help you promote your events. They could hype up your events, offer exclusive&nbsp;discount codes&nbsp;to your tickets, wear your event merch in their videos, and more. You could even invite influencers to come to your event and document their experience. That way, they can share it with their adoring fans, or maybe even share it live!\n\n\n\nTikTok Lives\n\n\n\nThe live streaming feature is a hidden gem of TikTok! By regularly going live, ideally 1-2 times per week, you give your event's TikTok account the chance to reach even more people and interact one-on-one with your followers. For each livestream, set a Live goal to encourage viewers to give you\u00a0Live Gifts\u00a0as a token of their appreciation (and as an extra revenue stream!). For your lives, try hosting Q&amp;A sessions, going behind the scenes at your venue, playing fun games with your special guests backstage, doing an interactive workshop, inviting your artists to play some live music, and more. You could also live stream snippets of your event day on TikTok to increase that FOMO for people who aren't there. You could partner with your sponsors, special guests, and other TikTok creators to bring some new energy to your live streams too! Plus, by going live within 1-2 hours of posting a TikTok, you'll help drive more views and engagement to that video.\n\n\n\n(Bonus!) More best practices\n\n\n\nThat's not all! Similar to your&nbsp;Instagram marketing strategy, you should regularly post quick images or video clips to your TikTok stories (they'll stay up for only 24 hours). As a simple yet powerful way to build engagement on your posts, dedicate some time to engaging with other content and creators in your TikTok event niche by liking, commenting, following, etc. Encourage your attendees to create TikToks at your events and to tag you in them. You may even consider hosting a contest for people who post TikToks they've made at your events or use a campaign-specific hashtag!\n\n\n\n\u200d\n\n\n\nNow you're better equipped than ever to tackle your TikTok event marketing! Remember, every social media platform requires a unique strategy, so your approach to achieving these goals on TikTok will differ from how you tackle other platforms like&nbsp;or Instagram. Social media is all about trying out tons of ideas until you find something that sticks and builds your fanbase of loyal event-goers, so have fun experimenting!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/64f0bdb022552e352f7f56b1_concert-crowd-with-pink-blue-lights-scaled-1-1024x729.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

Your audience is always on the lookout for a unique, affordable, and fun way to get out, so why not show them what your drive-in movie theater is all about? As you prepare for your next drive-in movie event, follow our tips to make sure your attendees not only have a great time, but will become repeat customers ready for a sequel!\n\n\n\n1. Host movie nights around upcoming holidays\n\n\n\n\u200d Hosting holiday movie nights is a great way to drive more traffic to your drive-in, as many potential attendees will be actively looking for ways to celebrate. Whether you're ushering in spooky season with Halloween classics like\u00a0Hocus Pocus\u00a0and\u00a0Beetlejuice, Christmastime festivities with\u00a0A Christmas Story\u00a0or\u00a0It's a Wonderful Life, or even some romantic comedies ahead of Valentine's Day, matching your movie selections with the time of the year is a great way to regularly draw in crowds.\n\n\n\n2. Take an audience poll\n\n\n\n\u200d Embrace the power of the people! Send a questionnaire or survey to past attendees and on social media to help determine what kind of drive-in movie set up they would like to see next. Questions about their favorite movies, directors, genres, and more can help curate your selection and make&nbsp;planning your next roster of movies&nbsp;easier than ever! Remember: understanding your audience and showing them what they want is a big part of how to host a drive-in movie successfully!\n\n\n\n3. Offer special discount nights\n\n\n\n\u200d Use your historical ticketing data to discover what your most attended days and times usually are. To drive more attendance to days that typically see a lower turnout, like during the week, offer a special discount. For example, by offering half-priced tickets for matinees or a free drink on Wednesday night showings, you'll bring in more moviegoers who can't pass up a deal, while working within your event pricing strategy.\n\n\n\n4. Host \u201cThrowback Thursday\u201d nights\n\n\n\n\u200d Empower your attendees to go back in time to different eras of cinema by hosting throwback movie nights centered around different decades. Whether you're showcasing the silent movies of early cinema or the beginning of blockbusters in the \u201870s and \u201880s, you'll not only use the history of film to make your events a must-see, but you'll also entice attendees from all generations to visit. Plus, maybe they'll even learn more about the history of some of their favorite classics!\n\n\n\n5. Present director-focused specials\n\n\n\n\u200d Whether it's the tenth time or the hundred-and-tenth time, dedicated movie fans love seeing their favorite directors on the big screen! Hosting director-focused nights is a great theme that can appeal to hardcore fans and newer ones who are interested in dipping their toe into filmography. No matter if it's their latest release, their underrated gem, or the one that put them on the map, great directors have dozens of films you can choose from. You could even bring in local indie directors to present their films with an Q&amp;A session, then discuss how to do a drive-in movie showcase for indie films.\n\n\n\n6. Stock up on fan-favorite snacks\n\n\n\n\u200d You can't have an unforgettable drive-in movie set up without some snacks! In addition to your general ticket sales, selling concessions onsite is a great way to make more money for your organization. Plus, who doesn't like something to munch on during their favorite movie? Whether it's the classic candy and popcorn combo, or fan-favorite snacks like slushies and licorice, make sure you stock up so all your moviegoers can get what they need to prepare for a great viewing experience! And if you need some manpower to manage your concession stand, consider&nbsp;hiring additional staff&nbsp;for your drive-in movie so you can save time and focus on the big picture (no pun intended).\n\n\n\n7. Promote your upcoming screenings\n\n\n\n\u200d Use every tool at your disposal to&nbsp;get the word out&nbsp;about your upcoming showings, especially free mediums like social media and&nbsp;email. You can post movie times, testimonials from satisfied customers, and links to your website, so your followers know just what to expect after they buy tickets. Plus, a recurring email newsletter with special deals is a great way to further your reach and make sure moviegoers know how awesome your drive-in is.\n\n\n\n8. Work with an easy-to-use ticketing solution\n\n\n\nMake the purchase process easier than ever and drive more advanced ticket sales by working with a user-friendly ticketing platform. With a platform like&nbsp;TicketLeap, you can get your tickets on sale in minutes, offer&nbsp;different price levels, and easily track your inventory. And with our full-feature set and resource guides, you'll have everything you need to learn how to host a drive-in movie that stands out from the rest and keep moviegoers rolling in!\n","date":"14 Sep 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/6390c571f117a018f4a6d790_drive-in-4-alt-1024x538.png","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

Check out our tips to set a foundation for your event publicity.\n\n\n\nPut away your books, it's test time! Don't worry, the answers are right below the questions, so you can learn as you go.\n\n\n\nWe've never met an event planner who would turn down coverage, but getting press is not as easy as it sounds. Test your knowledge on what you need to do to put together the foundation of a publicity plan that will put your event in front of more editors, who can, in turn, boost your event promotion to more people.\n\n\n\nIf a press release is going to be successful, how should it be written?\n\n\n\n\nLike the great American novel, to tell the entire story of the event from conception to fruition!\n\n\n\nLike a scientific fact sheet, void of inspiration. Clinical.\n\n\n\nFlowery, lyrical with a dash of science fiction thrown in\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the middle of all of these \n\n\n\n\nANSWER: Writing a press release is an art form in itself. If you've never written a press release before, don't sweat it. They sound a little intimidating, but ultimately they're an information piece that makes sure the reader has all the pertinent information on your event, plus a few highlights to peak the reader's interest. They're short and sweet, and when you go the extra mile to make your press release great, it can lead to big things like interviews in newspapers, magazines, websites, radio, and possibly television.\n\n\n\nHOT TIP: When you're crafting the perfect press release, remember the people reading aren't your event attendees, they're members of the media or the press. That means your press release is your chance to pitch your angle, and there's no room for modesty in there! Does your main speaker have an Olympic Gold medal? Talk about it! Has your headliner performed in dozens of countries around the world? Throw that in there! Did your event planners produce that other awesome thing last summer in the park? Ya, she did! Anything about your event that makes it different, make sure you pitch it.\n\n\n\nWhat else should you include in your press release?\n\n\n\n\nYour contact information\n\n\n\nA poster about your event\n\n\n\nA meme people might find funny\n\n\n\nA photo from past events to give context\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: All of the above except C. Your press release is a tool to make writing about your event as easy as humanly possible. Editorial staff in newsrooms and print houses are notoriously overworked, so providing a document that has all the tools for them to create a story will make it far more likely that they write about your event. Including a visual like a poster or a photo will not only give them an idea of the spirit of your event branding and style of your event, they can also include that in their piece. Your contact information, we consider that a no brainer, but we'd blame ourselves if you forgot to add it in!\n\n\n\nIf you were building a media list to send your press release, who would you add to it?\n\n\n\n\nLocal blogger\n\n\n\nNews anchor\n\n\n\nInfluencers\n\n\n\nRadio stations\n\n\n\nCommunity Websites\n\n\n\nLocal Editors\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: All of the above - and probably more. It's not about having a concise list; it's about having a definitive list. If you're putting on a concert or festival, don't send your press release to the reporter who covers City Hall - this is about sending it to people who have a direct correlation to your event, and whose readers will be interested to hear more about what you're doing.\n\n\n\nIf you're using social media to get a little publicity, which strategies should you use?\n\n\n\n\nSend a message to everyone you think might be interested in your event, and even people who might not be on your social media platforms.\n\n\n\nPost your press release and include a relevant hashtag\n\n\n\nFind Facebook Groups where people can pitch stories\n\n\n\nGet lost watching videos of baby otters on X and every half hour or so, remind yourself what you should be doing instead\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: Heed our warning - answer A almost never works. In fact, sometimes it fails so hard, it has the opposite effect intended, and people purposely ignore your event. To connect with the press on social media, incorporate a little bit of B and C for a proactive, but not overwhelming approach (we've tried getting coverage through answer D, but it's never worked)\n\n\n\nYou've booked an interview with the media! You should:\n\n\n\n\nRehearse your \"No Comment\" strategies and answers to hypothetical questions that may never arise\n\n\n\nRehearse your key talking points and eliminate words such as \"umm\" and \"like\" from your answers\n\n\n\nStop everything, go to the mall and buy a whole new outfit\n\n\n\nCall everyone you know and tell them to watch\n\n\n\n\nANSWER: Well, this one we made pretty obvious only because if you've just booked your first television, radio or print interview, you might be nervous. Relax and spend time every day rehearsing your talking points. What is your event, who is your event for, why are you organizing your event, when is your event, and where can people get tickets? Rehearse those things over and over in your mind until you feel extra confident about your answers. You'll find that even if you have butterflies in your stomach during your interview, it will go better than you expected because the words will flow out of your mouth.\n","date":"17 Aug 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/61f43062f5488e431a28cc62_5dd2d3bdd5cda65e968cae42_austin-distel-PkS3hCZmYts-unsplash-p-2600-scaled-1-1024x704.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":53,"name":"Event Marketing","slug":"event-marketing","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":53,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Marketing your event effectively is vital to boosting your ticket sales and getting more attendees in the door!

The answer is absolutely yes! However, hosting a private event with friends is much different from a huge community-wide party, so make sure your specific type of event abides by all the local laws. Here are some clear guidelines to help you serve wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages the right way!\n\n\n\nDo you need a liquor license to serve alcohol?\n\n\n\nIf you're selling alcohol (which is a solid way to make money at your event!), then yes, you will need a license. Or, if you're selling tickets and serving alcohol, like at a paint and sip, a liquor license is required. It's super important to determine how to obtain the proper licensing while you\u2019re planning your event, so you can go into your event day with confidence.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to know is that liquor licenses vary by state. This means, while we may not have one perfect answer for you, we can give you directions on how to secure a liquor license in your region. Some states make it much easier to understand than others. For example, Oregon's legal definition is a great place to start. According to their website, licensing is required at your event when:\n\n\n\n\n\u200bAlcohol will be sold.\u200b\n\n\n\nAlcohol is available (but not being sold), and you are charging or accepting donations for admission.\n\n\n\nAny type of payment is required to attend the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you don't need a liquor license for an event\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Oregon's website states that a liquor license is not needed at special events where you are making alcohol available, but there is no payment or purchase required, and no donations of money are accepted (e.g., for alcohol, for entry, for admission, or for any other product or service at the event).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis can include serving alcohol at a private event like a wedding reception where guests can enjoy some booze, but you don't require payment or purchase and don't accept donations.\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, contact your state's liquor board through their government website and explain what your needs are, so you can determine what documentation to file to receive your appropriate liquor permit. Do you know other event organizers in your community? Ask them how they got their temporary permit for serving alcohol in your specific region.\n\n\n\nState variations in liquor licenses\n\n\n\nKeep in mind, there are subtle differences between states. For example, in Indiana, you can only get a license for beer and wine. If you want to serve liquor, you need a licensed caterer.\n\n\n\nCounties within the same state may even have varying laws depending on if they are \"wet\", \"dry\", or \"moist\". A wet county allows the sale of alcohol while a dry country prohibits all sale of alcohol. A moist county, however, permits the sale of alcoholic beverages in certain situations. Additionally, there may be different policies regarding for profit events versus those hosted by nonprofit organizations.\n\n\n\nTo confirm what happens in your state, search \u201ctemporary liquor license for an event\u201d on Google and then type in your state or city. You'll need to use those exact words, because a \u201cspecial event license\u201d is a separate type of license, and your event likely won't need that. If you are hosting your event somewhere that already has a liquor license and using their staff, you will not need a separate license.\n\n\n\nHow much do liquor licenses cost?\n\n\n\nThis varies heavily by state. Usually, this will range within a few hundred dollars. For example, California's license costs $50-75 per day, or their special temporary license is $100. Luckily, because you're only needing a temporary permit as an event, it won't cost nearly as much for you as it would for a restaurant purchasing an annual license for their alcohol served.\n\n\n\nAlternative ways to serve alcohol without getting a permit\n\n\n\nWanting to serve alcohol at your event, but wanting to skip securing a liquor license? When selecting your event venue, prioritize options that offer bar services. If they let you run a cash bar, attendees can purchase alcohol straight from the venue, saving you from having to purchase drinks at all as the organizer.\n\n\n\nIf the venue doesn\u2019t have a bar service, consider hiring a professional caterer! They\u2019ve already obtained a license to serve food and drink, and your venue is their \u201clicensed premises\u201d. You\u2019ll need to check with them of any requirements like a percentage of food sales required in proportion to drink sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of event insurance\n\n\n\nNow that we've got that sorted, event insurance is the next important piece to the puzzle. Lucky for you, once you've got a liquor license, this is going to seem easy! For any event, but especially those with alcohol, it's wise to have event insurance. Even venues that already have a liquor license will probably ask you to get additional event insurance. This is easy to do. Call up your regular insurance provider and they will give you a quote. You can also do this online. The cost will range from about $75 to a few hundred dollars, depending on if you\u2019re a small event with no alcohol versus looking for around $1 or $2 million in event insurance. Keep in mind, if you\u2019re serving alcohol, you\u2019ll need to include liquor liability coverage.\n\n\n\nCheers to hosting your next event with confidence!\n\n\n\nThat's it! You're all set to secure a liquor license (and your event insurance!) for your upcoming events. As you build your event page, keep in mind to clarify in your event description if you're serving alcohol and have any age restrictions on who can attend. With TicketLeap's full suite of features, you can include custom questions in the purchase process to learn more about your attendees (e.g., how many are of drinking age) and even embed a waiver at checkout for them to sign too. Now, go forth and toast your newfound knowledge with a signature cocktail at your event!\n\n\n\n\n","date":"17 Aug 2023","author_name":"TicketLeap","thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.ticketleap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/61f7edccf8f2a640347a5e62_5e3988adcf71116969bfdf07_priscilla-du-preez-W3SEyZODn8U-unsplash-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg","category_obj":[{"term_id":54,"name":"Event Planning","slug":"event-planning","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":54,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Event planning is where the magic happens!

Whether it's encouraging genuine conversations, bonding with your community over shared experiences, or fundraising for local mental health organizations, these kinds of events are a great launchpad for impacting mental health causes. If you're looking for mental health awareness month activities or just mental health event ideas, here's a list of ways to create super fun experiences that also can benefit your attendees' well-being.\n\n\n\n1. Art fair&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTeam up with local artists to share their beautiful artwork with your community and gain a range of rich perspectives that can truly resonate with your attendees. Set up QR codes that provide insightful descriptions of each piece and allow your artists to share the personal stories behind their creations. Plus, encourage your attendees to express themselves creatively by offering interactive opportunities, like painting stations or guided pottery workshops. You can even utilize donation booths to advocate and&nbsp;fundraise&nbsp;for mental health initiatives in your area!\n\n\n\n2. Hackathon\n\n\n\nThis is an especially well-suited&nbsp;college event idea&nbsp;for STEM majors! Bring together a mix of incredible talent, from tech wizards to creative designers, to collaborate with mental health experts. Through your event, separate your competitors into teams to develop and pitch tech solutions that'll make a difference (i.e., mobile apps for on-the-go support or wearables that inspire well-being). As they brainstorm, be sure your venue is equipped with ample charging stations and keep the energy flowing with nourishing refreshments to fuel those creative minds. To take this event to the next level,&nbsp;sell tickets online&nbsp;to your local community to come cheer on the hackathon competition and have the proceeds help fund the winning idea!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. Nature retreat&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScout out a serene location like a lush forest, calm lakeside, or cozy mountain hideaway to host a relaxing nature retreat! Offer a blend of experiences like yoga sessions, meditation journeys, hikes, and stress management workshops. To foster a safe and supportive environment, recruit some expert instructors who can help guide your attendees on their wellness journey. As an extra touch, consider assembling event swag bags with self-care essentials and other useful items for your attendees to take home with them.\n\n\n\n4. Culinary workshop&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStir up an empowering (and delicious!) experience that's not only about cooking, but also about nurturing your mental health. Work with talented chefs to show your attendees how to embrace the art of cooking as a way to practice mindfulness. They'll walk your attendees through irresistible recipes while emphasizing the importance of using fresh, nutritious ingredients. Hungry yet? As their meals are sizzling in the pan or roasting in the oven, sprinkle in some insights on how certain foods can impact your mood. By the end, your attendees will feel accomplished and become more mindful throughout the cooking process.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Film festival&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHandpick a mix of captivating documentaries, short films, and movies that cast a fresh spotlight on topics related to mental health. Secure an inviting venue with suitable projection and sound accommodations for an immersive cinematic experience. On your&nbsp;event's big day, invite your attendees, participating filmmakers, and mental health advocates in your community to make their way down your red carpet to your festival. Before the films play, let your filmmakers share a brief backstory behind their films. Then, as the credits roll, host Q&amp;A sessions with the creators to dive deeper. You could even give your attendees a guide to help ignite meaningful post-screening conversation. To top the night off, consider contributing proceeds from your ticket sales or collecting donations for a local non-profit organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. Community mural project&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCapture the strength of overcoming adversity through painting a mural in your community. First,\u00a0select a venue\u00a0with enough wall space and ensure you've gained the necessary permissions to paint in that location. Next, gather a team of enthusiastic artists to help sketch out the mural concept and map it onto your wall. Once you've solidified your design, host mural painting days to invite your whole community to help paint designated sections of the project. That way, locals of all ages can join in the fun \u2013 no artistic skills required! As your mural takes shape, make sure to take lots of\u00a0event photos. That way, you can share them on social media to help create a buzz and rally more support for your cause. Then, once you're finished, organize a mural unveiling event to bring people together to celebrate your masterpiece and what it represents.\n\n\n\n7. Mental health panel and workshop series&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAssemble a panel of mental health experts, from psychologists to therapists, to ignite conversations around the subject. As you brainstorm your mental health workshop ideas, opt for a unifying theme like \u201cCoping Strategies for Everyday Wellness\u201d or \u201cCultivating Mindfulness Together.\u201d Feature local mental health organizations by offering them&nbsp;sponsorship opportunities, fundraising for their cause, or letting them share about their community impact during your panels. Offer thought-provoking Q&amp;A sessions, interactive exercises, and workshops on practicing mindfulness, navigating burnout, and more. You may even consider&nbsp;live streaming&nbsp;or offering&nbsp;virtual panels&nbsp;to make your event even more accessible to a wider range of attendees. By the end, you're sure to leave your participants with practical tools for improving their personal well-being!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n8. Charity concert\n\n\n\nInvite talented musicians to perform for an evening and help raise awareness for mental health. To set the stage, decorate your concert venue with string lights and cozy seating arrangements. During the concert, allow your artists the opportunity to share the stories behind their songs and how their music has helped them through adversity. For a more personal touch, you could even offer valuable resources such as pamphlets on mental health and ways to donate to related nonprofit organizations. Depending on how many artists you have, you could also try hosting a writers' round where songwriters share the stage and take turns playing their songs in support of your event's cause.\n\n\n\n9. Pet &amp; play\n\n\n\nBy merging the therapeutic power of pets with mental wellness, this puppy-filled event is sure to leave a paw-sitive impact on all your participants (pun intended!). For this, partner with local animal shelters or pet therapy organizations to connect their adorable furry friends with your event-goers. Choose a serene outdoor venue or a spacious indoor space to accommodate both pets and people comfortably. Then, let your attendees cut loose to play with their animals, go on a brief walk with them, or even do some pet-friendly guided meditation.&nbsp;Encourage attendees to bring their own pets too (or adopt one of the shelter's pets!) and chat with fellow animal lovers about the mental health benefits of pet companionship.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReady to turn your vision into reality?
